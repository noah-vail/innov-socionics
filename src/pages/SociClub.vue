              When a group consists of people of this club, but without either
              of the two quadras having greater presence, its members tend to
              limit their interactions to the exchange of ideas in their common
              areas of interests, with little focus on the interchange of
              personal experiences regarding relationships, or physical
              activities besides perhaps walks with ongoing discussions.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              Typical examples of this club are enthusiasts of
              <strong class="roboto-bold highlight-text">science fiction</strong>,
              <strong class="roboto-bold highlight-text">role-play games</strong>, groups of
              <strong class="roboto-bold highlight-text">political discussions</strong>, and
              the like. This kind of group behavior, though, in terms of seeing
              a club as any kind of unit, is visible only as long as the group
              is held together by, and focuses on, discussions and activities of
              their common interests. Longer and deeper interactions make such a
              club visibly "split" into the two quadras, Alpha and Gamma

              Due to the divide in valued information elements between the Alpha
              and Gamma researchers, the researcher club can be further divided
              and described by quadra. These contrasting characteristics are
              maintained by club members of each quadra even when interacting
              with members of the opposing quadra, and despite the fact that all
              the members may be focused on the same goal, interest, etc.

              Pragmatists are inclined to regard Researchers with a mix of
