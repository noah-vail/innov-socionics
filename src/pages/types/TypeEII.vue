                          The EII keenly discerns what kind of relationships
                          exist between other people. She knows who does and
                          doesn’t get along with whom. However, she is not as
                          adept at correctly discerning the attitudes directed
                          towards herself i.e. in what regard others hold her,
                          due to which she may suffer by being too gullible. The
                          EII values honesty and basic sense of decency in human
                          relations. She does not forgive treachery and
                          betrayals and will break off all relations with those
                          who have seriously let her down. However, she may
                          forgive her offenders if they sincerely repent and ask
                          for her forgiveness. In general, she tries to maintain
                          stable and friendly relations with everyone. When she
                          is interacting with others at a distance, she is
                          distinguished by gentleness and precaution in
                          communication. Endowed with the gift of generosity.
                          Her goodwill she shows by supportive deeds rather than
                          by lofty words and loud declarations.

                          EII feels most comfortable in a small, familiar
                          company. Shows concern for the feelings and moods of

                          how to alleviate their emotional pain and stress. Her

                          to her. Internally, she is emotionally strained and
                          nervous. Although she is able to control her own
                          emotions, occasionally she needs to have an emotional
                          release. In such instances, she loses control and may

                          relatives, accusing them of selfish motives, lies and
                          indifference.

                          She strives to discover various implicit relationships
                          between concepts, people, objects, doctrines and
                          theories usually of general and humanistic nature.
                          Like no one else she understands the impact of ideas
                          on people’s lives. Loves learning and educating
                          herself. Appreciates friendly exchange of opinions and
                          news, which creates an atmosphere of trust and respect
                          for the position of another person. Supports mutual

                          has an innate talent for teaching and educating.
                          Treats children as adults and encourages them to be
                          independent and to acquire skills necessary for adult
                          life. Able to orient in the most difficult life
                          situations. People turn to her for advice to confirm
                          that there exists a possibility of what they wish for
                          or what they fear.

                          sharply to any attempts to influence her by coercion
                          and brute force. In such situations the EII flares up,
                          and explicitly and poignantly expresses her negative
                          attitude. Becomes very irritated and disturbed when
                          she has to deal with those who oppose her. Although
                          she feels very nervous in extreme situations, she
                          pulls herself together and acts decisively, especially
                          if the situation touches dear to her people. A wave of

                          others and expresses her disapproval, but is unable to

                          look, although appreciates approval and advice
                          regarding how she looks. Avoids bright clothing that
                          makes her stand out. Her mood is highly dependent on
                          her state of physical well-being. When she is

                          care of them, but needs for this to be acknowledged

                  himself and may burst out in disagreement or indignation, but
                  comes to regret it later.

                  Serious and fastidious, prefers to hold himself with some
                  reserve and subtlety. Dresses simply, adhering to classical
                  styles, often conservatively. His mimicry and gestures are
                  weakly expressed. Speech is emotional and slightly inhibited;
                  its tone is often didactic. Frequently has a disproportionate
                  figure, often squat in physique and prone to corpulence. Gait
                  may be a bit clumsy and waddling.
