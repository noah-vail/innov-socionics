                          ILI attentively follows the flow of life. He is keenly

                          balance of the useful to the useless. He seeks the
                          shortest and the most worthwhile route to the goal.
                          Thrifty with money and knows how to save for the

                          Prudent in matters of comfort and health. Going out or
                          going on a trip brings along a set of objects that
                          provide a guaranteed minimum level of convenience.
                          Keeps himself to standards of hygiene, maintains
                          cleanliness. Puts in effort into keeping himself
                          healthy, sometimes resorting to traditional methods.
                          Often is a food gourmand. Can prepare special dishes
                          that satisfy his tastes. Predisposed to use of
                          high-quality, sophisticated products, although during
                          times of shortage is able to get by on very simple
                          food. His external appearance is either unkempt and
                          neglected or, on the contrary, carefully devised in
                          accord with the current norms. This depends on his
                          social circle and the nature of his audience.

                          Estimates attitudes towards himself by displays of
                          emotions. Boisterous, intrusive, emotions he finds
                          irritating; they have a subduing and depressing effect
                          on him. In extreme situations, or when he feels hidden
                          antagonism, he can openly express his annoyance, fly
                          off the handle and make demands in a sharp manner. If
                          his state is poor, he transforms it into black humor.
                          Can deliver a short, acerbic remark. His gravitation
                          towards other people is once again dependent on his
                          current mood. In high spirits he can even be obsessive
                          and intrusive; in poor mood he withdraws and rests in
                          seclusion.

                          however, it rarely comes to implementation. He needs
                          to be prodded from outside, requires strong support.
                          Absence of such support leads to demobilization and
                          laziness. Direct aggression is detestable to him; he
                          opposes it in every way. He cannot endure protracted
                          confrontation simply leaves or even falls ill. For his

                          His emotional state depends on how he is treated by

                          attention, if nobody responds to his proposals and
                          objections. If he is in poor mood, do not try to
                          comfort and cheer him, but leave him alone with his
                          thoughts of express indirect sympathy. In dealing with
                          strangers, he can be polite, behave as a well-mannered
                          and intelligent person. Has a diplomatic streak; can
                          work on reconciling the interests of all parties. To
                          close interpersonal distance and strike up a

                          unrestrained manner. However, if the other party does
                          not respond, he stop his attempts at rapprochement.

                          come up with something himself is difficult for him.
                          Skeptical about the prospects of new initiations and

                  soul he is an idealist who envisions a beautiful, harmonious,
                  and prosperous life, but is quite passive in finding the means
                  to achieve it. Internally contradictory, critical and
                  distrusting, though doesn’t always show this. Subject to
                  frequent doubts and fluctuations. Through his strong intuition
                  he is able to predict the outcome of any undertaking or
                  behavior of a person in any given situation. Often gives
                  advice to exercise caution to avoid unpleasant surprises and
                  troubles. Appreciates old, time-tested truths. Feels
                  susceptible to the fluctuations of life thus he tries to
                  foresee everything; for example, before a trip he thinks over
                  all the details and brings with him everything that may become
                  necessary. Prone to remembering his failures and mishaps for a
                  long time. Frequently falls into melancholy due to excessive
                  pessimism. Though he is often endowed with a fertile
                  imagination and loves new experiences, in reality he
                  gravitates towards stability, safety and security. When he
                  feels too bogged down by the monotony, he gladly takes on

                  difficult to pressure and persuade anyone into anything -
                  prefers reaching an agreement on mutually beneficial terms.
                  However, sometimes he becomes very stubborn and intractable,
                  especially if he sees that a person acts without taking into

                  Has difficulty maintaining an inner balance due to heightened
                  sensitivity and vulnerability. Due to his inability to control
                  his moods and to switch his attention to something else,
                  sometimes he is excessively fault-finding and cantankerous and
                  other times too kind and accommodating. His emotions transfer
                  to others. Knowing this, he prefers to spend time in solitude
                  when he is in a poor mood, so as not to regret later something
                  said or done in the heat of the moment. In a good mood, he is
                  a charming and pleasant companion who with his attentiveness
                  and sensitivity predisposes toward trust and willingly shares
                  his advice.

                  able to extract maximum returns while applying minimum of
                  effort. Capable of making accurate economic and political
                  predictions. Encourages people to be active, but also warns
                  against any activities that are useless in his opinion.
                  Notices all the contradictions and imperfections of his
                  surrounding world. Due to a developed sense of skepticism it
                  is difficult for him to properly assess the potential of new
                  ventures and people’s abilities. While calling for prudence,
                  he can cool any excessive enthusiasm with subtle irony.

                  Possesses organizational skills. Tries to be able in his
                  affairs and knowledgeable over a variety of issues.
                  Appreciative of quality work and high qualifications. Has an
                  interest in laws and regulations, collects necessary and
                  interesting information. It’s hard to reconvince him in an
                  argument because he often proves his point of view supplying
                  factual information. Sufficiently stubborn, does not yield to
                  direct pressure.

                  May have a wide circle of professional or business
                  acquaintances, but rarely becomes truly close with anyone.
                  Fearing becoming dependent on someone tries to appear
                  self-sufficient and confident in himself. Despite this, he is
                  often in need of moral support. Likes people who with their
                  optimism can instill confidence in success. Critically
                  perceives the shortcomings of others. Sometimes cannot
                  withhold himself from making a critical remark, due to which
                  it is difficult for him to maintain smooth relations with
                  others.

                  Internally emotional, but tries to be self-sustained. Dislikes
                  falling to extremes, but if his principles are violated he may
                  flare up. Usually restrained in expression of his feelings,
                  dislikes making compliments, considers that it’s more sincere
                  to talk of shortcomings. In this case, with his
                  straightforwardness may not spare another’s self-esteem.
                  Poorly tolerates discomfort, both external and internal, and
                  therefore tries to smooth out a bad impression left by
                  something he has said.

                  Thrifty, economical and practical. Dislikes excesses, can
                  suffice with less. Skillfully handles objects and finances.
                  Good with handling his documentation. Shows creativity in
                  handling practical matters. Can adapt and extract use from
                  things that to others seem to have outlived their use. Modest
                  in his appearance and in everyday life. Feels awkward claiming
                  for himself any material privileges or rewards. Does not
                  attribute much value to accessories, but feels insecure if his
                  appearance does not match the tastes of his society. Rather
                  passive when resting. Due to weak self-discipline and certain
                  measure of inertia he underestimates the role of a healthy
                  lifestyle, due to which his health may suffer.
