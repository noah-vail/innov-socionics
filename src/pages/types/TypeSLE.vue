                          SLE is a resolute person who can provide volitional
                          pressure if the situation requires this. He is
                          determined to win at any cost. The more obstacles he
                          encounters along the way, the more collected and
                          energetic his advance becomes. Doubt and hesitation
                          are foreign to him; he feels convinced of his right.
                          Categorical in his assessments, reserves the last
                          word. He is primarily interested in the result, not
                          the process of achieving it. Adept at calculating
                          various plans of action in his mind, choosing the most
                          logical one for the given situation. Knows how to find
                          the most compromised point of his opposition. If a
                          direct attack does not bring success, can try to
                          bypass from the sides or from the back, work through
                          third parties. Feels lost in unusual, illogical
                          situations.

                          Able to unite people around him to achieve a specific
                          goal. Clearly delineates everyones position on the
                          team. Confidently coordinates joint actions. Presents
                          an ultimatum: “If you have chosen me, now you have to
                          listen to me.” Explains everything simply and clearly,
                          citing illustrative examples. Tries to control the key
                          points only without wasting efforts on details. Grasps
                          the situation as a whole. Flexibly readjusts if the
                          activity is no longer promising. For each task he
                          devotes a certain period of time after which he makes
                          the final decision: to continue on or to stop.
                          Captures well the logic of actions of other people;
                          thus the only ones who can win with him are those who
                          are constantly changing it. Tests people in action,
                          throwing those who lack training into the midst of
                          things.

                          SLE experiences difficulty establishing personal
                          relations in informal situations. Often he is too
                          intolerant and uncompromising, predisposed to dictate
                          his own way in his relations. Intolerant when someone
                          else places demands of personal commitment from him.
                          Constructs a system of ethical values for himself that
                          often does not correspond to what is generally
                          accepted. Frequently disbelieves that there exist
                          pure, platonic relations. Sometimes declares that he
                          is for “fairness”, for equal treatment of everyone;
                          nevertheless, has favorites and scapegoats. Treats
                          well those who respect his friends and oppose his
                          enemies. Does not let go of those to whom he has grown
                          attached; attempts in any way to make them enter a
                          dependent relationship with him, to “tame” or
                          “placate” them.

                          the future. Pessimism and superstitions anger him. He
                          is soothed and relaxed by a light, hassle-free
                          communication style and optimistic outlook.
                          Periodically turns to thoughtful introspection.
                          Withdraws into himself, reflecting on future prospects
                          and emerging opportunities. Time softens his harsh
                          temper. After suffering a series of inexplicable
                          losses and defeats, he begins to wonder about fate,
                          may turn to religion, occupy himself with charity
                          work. He is very enterprising and venturous. Enjoys
                          competition, boisterous company, where he can relax
                          and emotionally recharge. Likes to be inspired and
                          uplifted. His emotional state heavily depends on the
                          emotional state of others around him. He likes to
                          listen to music. It puts him in the right disposition,
                          creates balance in his soul. Grows offended if he is
                          called an uncaring person.

                          when his abilities are questioned. Considers himself
                          to be intelligent. Handles well problems that test for
                          ingenuity. In public, he gladly demonstrates his
                          erudition and knowledge of the fundamentals. Not
                          averse to act in role of a patron. If he is taken to
                          the edge, he is able to manifest merciless and
                          relentless fury. At such moments he cannot stop
                          himself in anger. Does not give more than one chance.

                          loved ones. Without this feels unfulfilled, a failure.
                          Does not respect people who are frail, lacking in
                          physical exercise and training. Proud of his own good

                          possess one. Due to excess drive and energy, he is
                          prone to quickly dissipate his natural reserves of
                          health. External appearance tends to be either
                          inconspicuous or underscoring his high status. Has
                          poorly developed sense of harmony and aesthetic taste.
                          Highly susceptible to physical drives and tends to

                          express his opinion on a topic of discussion. Tries to
                          positively predispose a person towards himself with
                          attentiveness and sensitivity, asks many questions,
                          inquires about their problems, voices a wish to hear

                          dialogue, the following moment is characteristic of
                          this sociotype. After the replica of his conversation
                          partner, the SLE makes a pause, as if thinking things
                          over, trying to comprehend the information and provide
                          the needed answer. During this deliberation he tends
                          to squint his eyes.

                          finishing up a discussion is also noteworthy. Once he
                          has given everyone the opportunity to speak, he
                          expresses himself, as if giving a summary of the

                  Insistent, energetic, resolute person. While trying to achieve
                  his goals, he acts both directly and through intermediaries.
                  As a rule, he is capable of becoming the winner. Knows how to
                  manage people, can impose on them his wishes and will, to
                  involve and draw them in by useful and interesting projects
                  and tasks. Knows how to be liked and how to please others:
                  charming, possesses a sense of humor, a good
                  conversationalist. Natural leader: needs competition,
                  struggle, passion, victory, without these his vitality wanes.
                  Boredom is his first enemy. An absence of decent employment
                  and application of his abilities makes him quite a difficult
                  partner.

                  He is oriented at achieving major concrete goals, but often
                  runs into difficulty when trying to choose them. It takes time
                  for him to get going, he doubts, thinks things over again. But
                  once he makes a choice, he acts swiftly, amping up his pace
                  and not resting until he has realized the conceived. A very
                  resourceful and flexible tactician. Active and operative, in
                  periods of elation his capacity for work is very high. Doesn’t
                  like unasked for advice, prefers to make decisions
                  independently. Can hear out his conversation partner, but
                  leave the last word to himself. Doesn’t tolerate commanding
                  tone in others. If someone tries to pressure him, he
                  resolutely counters it. In the interest of his business, shows
                  diplomatic abilities, be considerate and courteous.

                  Dislikes it very much when others show initiative that seems
                  to be out of place, for example, try to impose something or
                  hurry others - in this case, can do the opposite. Very
                  self-loving and easily offended, but tries to hide it,
                  considering this to be his weakness. Doesn’t forgive
                  tactlessness and injustice towards himself. This can provoke a
                  flash of aggression in him.

                  ridicule him in presence of strangers, to put him on the spot.
                  Actively asserts his interests, and those of his loved ones.
                  Can create an unfavorable environment for disagreeable people,
                  but for those whom he loves, he tries to provide the necessary

                  confidence in his own rightness and insufficient
                  self-criticism do not simplify his relations with others.
                  Respects people who are influential and authoritative. Lenient
                  and forgiving towards those who are compliant, soft and
                  vulnerable, in need of help, especially towards children.
                  Often provides them his protection and support. Nonetheless,
