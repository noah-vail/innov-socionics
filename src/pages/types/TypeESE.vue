                          sacrifice it for the sake of his family. A good

                          Quite fussy and scattered. Often overloads himself
                          with things to do, which very much exhausts him.

                          and skillful person. Often thinks himself impractical,

                          effort and work. Does his work quickly, but likes it
                          when he is helped with some things. Could use outside

                          his activities. Sometimes he starts on the most
                          important task in the last minute, with which he
                          sentences himself to unnecessary rushing and stress.
                          Appreciates people who warn him about how much time he
                          has left in reserve. Vacillates for a long time before
                          undertaking major, potentially life-changing
                          decisions. Remembers about his past mistakes, but acts
                          not in accord with practical experience, but by
                          subjective tendencies. Suppresses in himself any
                          apprehensive feelings of misfortunes and disasters,
                          and instead orients himself at a positive outcome. Due
                          to this, many of his hopes and expectations lead to
                          disappointments. Impatient, dislikes waiting. Does not

                          presented in a clearly structured form. Often a
                          conscientious person, has a responsible attitude
                          towards his assignments and duties, and cannot relax

                          Builds his relationships on basis of trust. Does not

                          repeat many times. Expects others to simply understand

                          time activities. Has a good sense of his body. Tries

                          strives to create an impression of aristocratic

                          the expression of negative emotions. Periodically, the
                          ESE openly expresses his indignation, often over minor
                          reasons. He rapidly flares up in temper, but calms
                          down just as quickly. This show of emotions cannot be
                          explained by objective logic: from some detail he can
                          create a drama, but at the same time not notice an
                          almost direct insult.

                          analyze who acted well and who acted poorly. Tracks
                          that the courtesy norms are being followed. If people
                          don’t follow ethical norms of interaction, the ESE
                          puts pressure on them by means of negative emotions.
                          Because of this, he may be viewed as a scandalous,
                          quarrelsome person. It’s not easy to get along with

                          events, and to prognose its further development. Don’t
                          start doing everything at once, otherwise you won’t be
                          able to do it all in time. Remember - no one is
                          safeguarded from surprises and unexpected happenings.

                  people. Successfully takes up any practical activity and likes
                  it when his efforts are appreciated. In the interests of his
                  project or his case, he with enthusiasm visits all the
                  appropriate centers and offices and files all the needed
                  paperwork. A good organizer, who tries to create the
                  conditions needed for effective work and encourages others to
                  work actively.

                  Frequently gets overwhelmed by work, chores, and errands, both
                  his own and those of others. Poorly calculates time, expending
                  a lot of effort on secondary and minor things. Due to this,
                  may run out of time and not finishing everything. Feels
                  ashamed of such lack of organization and tries to discipline
                  himself. Can be overly trusting and careless. Poorly foresees
                  the outcome of a new venture or project. Because of this may
                  commit rash actions, undertake wrong steps, and regret of them
                  later. Doesn’t always listen to the advice of others - prefers
                  to act in his own way.

                  Dislikes uncertainty in both professional and personal
                  respects. Gravitates towards stability, both at work and in
                  his personal life. Respects serious, reliable, goal-oriented
                  people. Loves it when information is presented concisely and
                  clearly, when the important parts are distinguished, and it is
                  based on facts. Expresses his own opinion when he is competent
                  in the given matter. Tries to be credible, authoritative, and
                  painfully experiences criticism of his work and professional
                  qualities.
