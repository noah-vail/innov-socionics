                          The LIE (ENTj) is very perceptive of positive
                          possibilities of new projects and undertakings. He
                          knows how to turn things around so that they bring him
                          tangible benefits. Criticizes those who, from his
                          point of view, are engaged in useless theories.
                          Adventurous, easily takes off at any moment. Often
                          takes up dynamic types of sports - running, hiking,
                          climbing, etc. Not afraid to travel and to change his
                          place of residence. Bravely forwards objective
                          proposals and presses for their implementation. If the
                          possibilities of the project have been exhausted,
                          quickly changes direction and switches to something
                          new. Takes care of his finances and if he has a sum of
                          money tries to keep it turning over, playing on the
                          price differences. Tries to concentrate the levers of
                          material interest in his hands.

                          LIE intuitively captures the main trends that develop
                          over time. He is not afraid to take risks, relying on
                          his intuition. He is proactive and tries to act in
                          advance, because he knows that tomorrow it will be too
                          late. LIE is usually one of the first people to take
                          advantage of new technologies and methods of
                          organization. In his thoughts, he is constantly
                          referencing the past, analyzing past events and
                          drawing lessons from them for the future. LIE is
                          attempting to find the basic laws of life and fate by
                          analyzing that has occurred over time. He is
                          interested in all the unusual and mysterious
                          phenomena. He tries to test them, to find their
                          rational basis.

                          An optimist - does not get discouraged under any

                          only toughen him and make more confident. He likes to
                          laugh and entertain people. Enters contact with
                          someone by involving him with a humorous remark. His
                          humor is often sly and contain hints and double
                          meanings. Easily enters into arguments and bets,
                          especially if he is challenged. When arguing his
                          points is often ironic, ridicules the views of his
                          opponent. His irritability and hot temper may be
                          unpleasant to others. However, he himself is not
                          perceptive of this and believes that he is simply
                          exchanging opinions.

                          once he has gotten used to it. Dresses up only when
                          it’s likely to have an impact concerning his personal
                          or professional relationships. Positively relates to

                          falls to extreme in relation to bad habits: either he
                          openly engages and flaunts them, or he actively
                          counters and fights against them. These extremes apply
                          to his sexual life.

                          attitude and friendliness on his territory. Feels
                          relaxed in an atmosphere of warm, sincere, soulful
                          communication. One should settle disagreements with

                          good intentions. He is much in need of reliable,
                          stable human relations. Due to his inability to
                          immediately recognize falsity can allow himself to get
                          drawn into poor company and questionable enterprises.
                          Appreciates reliable, time-tested friends. Usually

                          for methods to make amends. To this end, gives gifts

                            manifestation of sly humor, love of making jokes,
                            often with sexual undertones (usually for LIE
                            males). The slyness of LIE’s jokes is due to the
                            fact that they have a certain ambiguity, double
                            entendre nature to them, and can be interpreted in
                            various ways.

                            opponent, sometimes even making fun of and mocking
                            the person rather than his views. May insert

                            people at any cost. Remember that not everyone likes
                            the joking tone, and more so - irony and ridicule.
                            Avoid excessive emotional familiarity in
                            communication. Develop in yourself politeness and
                            good manners. This will boost your self-esteem and
                            instill greater level of respect that others have
                            for you.

                  where he can apply his efforts.

                  Diplomatic and gallant with everyone, especially with women,
                  but can show familiarity at closer acquaintance. Due to his
                  inclination to unceremoniousness, his sense of tact often
                  fails him, and he commits ethical mistakes, which he tries to
                  correct and mend with the help of jokes and his services.

                  Behaves himself simply, uninhibitedly, freely and easily. In
                  conversation sometimes like to touch his conversation partner,
                  to hug, to kiss, to make jokes.

                  This is a person of action with a developed creative
                  beginning. Has an active practical mind, very curious, and
                  boldly experiments. Often constructs far-reaching but concrete
                  plans. Impulsive, cheerful, enterprising, easily takes
                  initiative in new projects and beginnings. Quickly turns to
                  work, inspiring others to get involved with his own
                  enthusiasm. Bravely tackles implementing new ideas to life, as
                  he sees their prospects well into the future. Brave,
                  resourceful, far-sighted and shrewd. Instantly orients in
                  extreme situations and develops an effective plan of action.
                  If he is not involved in some project or activity, he starts
                  to feel bored and his vitality falls, but usually he is able
                  to quickly find application of his abilities in any activity.

                  Somewhat scattered, inclined to get distracted by secondary
                  and unimportant things, due to which may put off the main work
                  until later, but after a while returns to it. Impatient by
                  nature, may be careless and negligent with details. Dislikes
                  competing, manifesting selfish interests, demanding his right
                  to something. May cede his positions to more obstinate and
                  insistent partners. For the sake of justice or to defend an
                  idea in which he believes, may sacrifice his own interests.

                  Fluctuates in choosing which decision to go with, due to which
                  it is easy to talk him out of what he has conceived. Due to
                  internal doubts and contradictions he can be unpredictable in
                  his behavior. With difficulty endures the crash of his hopes,
                  but, with the inherent to his optimism, is not averse to start
                  everything anew, not looking back. Gravitates towards new
                  impressions and changes, often changes his hobbies and
                  interests, tries and tests himself in different spheres of
                  activity and occupations. A romantic at heart, enjoys travel,
                  sharp and thrilling impressions, sometimes tests and risks
                  with his fate. Faithful in relations, but not averse to
                  flirting. His personal life is often rather complicated and
                  changeable.

                  Emotional, fidgety, restless. Tries to do everything in time
                  and feels very worried when he sees that he cannot accomplish
                  everything by the deadlines. He is often in a hurry himself,
                  and hurries and urges others. Negatively refers to those who
                  are lazy, who seek convenience and enjoyment. In
                  conversations, he is lively and welcoming. Seems sincere,
                  original, straightforward, and predisposing towards trust.
                  Attentive towards other people, delves into their problems,
                  gives advice, offers his services, tries to encourage them,
                  make them laugh with jokes. If in the interests of the work or
                  business he finds it necessary to put pressure on other
                  people, tries to do it in inoffensive form, although he may be
                  too direct and pushy. Sometimes his sense of tact fails, and
                  he can inadvertently offend his conversation partner, but then
                  he tries to fix the situation immediately or very soon. He is
                  docile in nature: it’s difficult to pick a quarrel with him.

                  Interested in various unsolved and unexplored phenomena. Tries
                  to comprehend the essence of various events and
                  manifestations. Reflects and thinks over scientific, moral,
                  and philosophical questions. In his soul he is somewhat
                  suspicious and superstitious. At home undemanding, can do with
                  very little. Loves children and animals. Pays little attention
                  to his appearance. Wanting to be loved not for his appearance,
                  but for his inner qualities. In need of a person who can keep
                  him from committing rash actions.
