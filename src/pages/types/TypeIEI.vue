                          The IEI is guided by his intuitive presentiments. Due
                          to this quality he is capable of surviving in the most
                          difficult situations. He quickly distinguishes
                          falsehood, hypocrisy, artifice, degradation. Often
                          acts as if he has time to spare and puts off much
                          until tomorrow. Inclined to optimism, believes in a
                          bright future. Pictures and visions that the IEI
                          creates in his mind are usually much more attractive
                          to him than everyday life proves to be. Can calm
                          people down, instil hope and inspire them by telling
                          of coming changes for the better. In conversation,
                          dislikes highlighting mistakes of the past.

                          The IEI is well versed in nuances and ways of
                          emotional life. He is able to discern when a person is
                          in a good mood to turn to them with a request,
                          therefore it can be difficult to turn him down.
                          Graciously responds to the humor in life. Tells jokes
                          and anecdotes, acts in jest, prods those close to him,
                          evoking positive emotions in different ways.
                          Sensitively responds to fights between people who are
                          close to him. Seeks reconciliation, readily agrees to
                          compromise. Will willingly sacrifice himself to settle
                          conflicts. Internally troubled. Experiences a lot, but
                          hides his agitation and poor mood behind a soft smile.

                          aesthetic movements are pleasing to the eye. Flexible
                          and adaptable. Does not impose himself on anybody.
                          Instead, put in the effort to adjust to the habits and
                          tastes of people around him. Sometimes complains about
                          his health, poor care, indifference; however, in
                          extreme situations will pull himself together and
                          suppresses his pains. In a comfortable environment
                          around familiar acquaintances he gains confidence and
                          strength. In such situations may even allow himself to
                          issue orders.

                          The IEI is not inclined to save up money and keep
                          strict track of his finances. May spend substantial
                          sums on aesthetically pleasing, from his point of
                          view, items that aren’t always useful. If he falls
                          into financial difficulties, he knows whom to turn to
                          for help or finds something that he can sell. In
                          long-term relations does not forget to take into
                          account pragmatic considerations. Poorly related to
                          those who force him to work at an unusual and
                          uncomfortable for him pace and rhythm. Hopes for
                          leniency, indulgences, “smoke breaks” at work.

                          relationships to turn into despotism - in such cases
                          IEI will openly declare the stupidity and
                          primitiveness of blunt force. Has a good sense of
                          which kind of force to apply to achieve his goals.

                          a physical threat to himself or his loved ones. If he
                          is in a constant state of discomfort, begins to behave
                          provocatively, rudely, and aggressively; does it to
                          hide his soft nature. In absence of strong leadership,
                          the IEI becomes relaxed and disorganized to the point
                          of carelessness. It is easy to knock him off the right
                          track, to tempt him with something that promises
                          pleasant impressions. He easily acquires bad habits,
                          getting rid of which will require a lot of effort.

                          plunge him into despair. He begins to act

                          undertake informed decisions. Dislikes strict,
                          meticulous control. Constant firm discipline is not

                          concessions become delayed, and still no resolution

                  Soft and considerate person. In his heart he is a dreamer and

                  experiences from the past down to the smallest detail.
                  Somewhat unsure in himself, inclined to doubt and hesitate in

                  extracts from them lessons for the future. Thanks to a strong

                  but because of the tendency to idealize everything may also

                  Usually does not aspire to leadership and finds it difficult

                  management and production. Dislikes routine, monotony,
                  stereotypes, conventionality, strict order, having to follow
                  rules and regulations. Likes to talk about various
                  unconventional and mysterious phenomena, seeks new
                  experiences, feels attracted to interesting and unusual
                  people. Willingly accepts and promotes unordinary ideas and
                  innovative approaches, but shows caution in new ventures; in
                  such cases prefers to yield initiative to those who are more
                  assertive and energetic. However, if necessary, exhibits
                  outstanding diplomatic skills, achieving success where others,
                  more straightforward and impatient partners who do not
                  attribute much value to flexibility in relationships, would

                  opportunities. Respects strong, influential people. Needs

                  criticism of his work or investing effort that has not been

                  comfort. Cares about his own appearance as well as appearance
                  of others. Wasteful and uneconomical; can purchase needless
                  things; dislikes those who are frugal over minor purchases.
                  Does not attach much value to material things, and thus can be
                  careless with them. Borrowing or lending something, may forget
                  about it for a long time.
