                          SEE is perceptive of the balance of power. He quickly
                          detects who is strong and who is weak, who can be
                          pushed around and whom it’s better not to touch. Looks
                          for weak spots in people who are close to him.
                          Exerting pressure on these points, he is able to
                          change their behavior in a way that is most favorable
                          for him. He himself is not susceptible to such manner
                          of pressuring, will skillfully dodge it. Knows how to
                          stand up for himself. Reacts boisterously when his
                          freedom and opportunities are being limited. Orders
                          around those who are less resolute and decisive and
                          less confident in themselves. With a stronger partner
                          talks on equal terms. Always finds a way to draw
                          attention to himself.

                          SEE is very discerning of the system of relationships
                          that exist between people. He knows how to tell
                          someone precisely that which this person wants to hear
                          from him. However, he does not rush to fulfill his
                          promises if he doesn’t feel a particular need in this.
                          Balances between interests of the opposing groups,
                          successfully negotiating and bargaining. If it’s in
                          his interests, he easily reconciles with former
                          adversaries. Knows how to mend and improve previously
                          broken relations. However, most often he plays on
                          negative relations and dislikes rather than on
                          sympathies and positive relationships. He finds it
                          difficult to break relations that have run their
                          course. Instead he will let a person know indirectly
                          that he or she is no longer interesting to him.
                          Dislikes allowing people too close to himself, because
                          he feels that this imposes certain obligations on him.
                          Easily strikes up acquaintances and new contacts and
                          feels better and more confident in groups of people
                          rather than alone in everyday environment.

                          Presents himself as an original, unusual personality
                          which won’t be fitted into any frameworks. Inclined to
                          contrast himself with others around him. Often can
                          maintain a conversation on any topic, little by little
                          demonstrating that he is knowledgeable on a wide
                          variety of topics. Captures new information quickly,
                          but mostly on the surface. Periodically he is taken by
                          reflections and contemplations, during which time he
                          becomes self-absorbed. At such times, it seems to him
                          that people do not perceive him as he really is. Quite
                          capricious, moody and choosy. Will often highlight his
                          broad potential, his opportunities and great
                          prospects. Often argues and does not readily agree,
                          will defend his point of view and values on principle.

                          consideration. Those who ignore his remarks he will
                          consider to be his opponents. Dependent on the
                          established order within the area where he lives or
                          works. May complain about lack of organization and
                          disorder, although won’t enforce it himself, since he
                          doesn’t want to ruin his relations and his actions are
                          often not methodical. He only responds to the already
                          established hierarchy. With a person he communicates
                          either from a lower position, as a subordinate, or
                          from a higher position, as their superior. With
                          subordinates he is not ceremonious. Cannot tolerate
                          people around himself whom he dislikes, does
                          everything in his abilities in order to remove them.

                          lead a sedentary, lazy lifestyle, despairing and
                          criticizing everything. He enjoys constant change,

                          somewhere else and completely change his situation.
                          Tries to impose time that is most convenient to him.
                          Sometimes he is hurrying and rushing others, while at
                          others times he slows down and strongly inhibits any
                          quick decisions. If he needs to, will always find
                          something to pick on. Likes when he is being
                          persuaded, approached at some distance, told many

                          Hates it when someone violates his peace and

                          detriment of his own leisure. Looks after cleanliness
                          and the standards of hygiene. Squeamish. Criticizes

                          His productivity at work is highly dependent on his

                          even hard work, but when he is not in the mood, then
                          even very important work will remain undone. Energetic
                          in carrying out those tasks that can be done
                          immediately. If there is no quick returns, and ahead

                          for another course of action. Excitement and emotional

                          The main trait that identifies an SEE in communication

                          subordinated to rules that limit his concrete
                          activities. In such cases, the SEE may behave in a

                          his or her feelings. Openly expresses personal

                          after some time he can come back and reconcile, as if

                          times, to complain that he is not understood, that in
                          reality he is not how he seems to others.

                  cheer them up with original antics, and inspire any activity;
                  if he is in a bad mood, he prefers to be alone, or to
                  socialize with people who can give him their attention and
                  sympathies. At such times, he is inclined to over-dramatize

                  soulful discomfort when he needs to find a way out of a crisis

                  more often than he praises, but tries to do it in half-joking
                  manner. As a result of his impressionability, as well as the
                  contradictory nature of his character, it is rare that he
                  achieves an inner balance. Finds it difficult to maintain
                  smooth and stable relationships with other people. In his
                  heart and soul he is a maximalist, and expects more than he
                  can achieve. Thus, he is inclined to often feel disappointed
                  in people who were initially sympathetic to him.
