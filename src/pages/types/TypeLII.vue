                          LII knows how to logically and convincingly express
                          his thoughts. He creates schemes and
                          conceptualizations, distinctly separates the important
                          from the secondary. Once he develops a general idea of
                          schematic, he works on reifying it and bringing it
                          closer to practice. Pure theorizing, philosophizing,
                          discussions that are completely removed from the life
                          are not for him. The correctness of the system he
                          evaluates by its internal logical consistency. Easily
                          modifies the formal framework of a system. Prefers
                          compact information that has been formulated as
                          concisely as possible, although may expand it in
                          volume if necessary. LII is well aware of the
                          potentialities and possibilities of ideas, concepts,
                          models, schemes and systems. Gives an objective,
                          impartial assessment of a their potential. Knows how
                          to tie in details and particulars to the whole.

                          Persistently fills the missing links of any system
                          that is of interest to him. Alternative ideas do not
                          escape his attention. He is well capable of generating
                          ideas and proposals and brainstorming. Thinks very
                          independently. Once he understood a problem, he puts
                          forward innovative solutions. Ideas come to him
                          intuitively by guessing. Logic for him is only a way
                          of framing information that he obtains intuitively. He
                          is able to disentangle a confusing, ambiguous problem.
                          Intuitively searches for hidden relationships. Lack of
                          evidence replaces with imagination. Penetrates deeper
                          and deeper into the object of study.

                          Not very sociable. He finds it difficult to build
                          relationships with people. Makes an effort to behave
                          kindly and enter into close contact. Hides his
                          personal life from outsiders. Does not like uninvited
                          guests, doesn’t know with what to occupy them. In
                          communication very careful. Contributes to the
                          conversation only when it concerns matters that are
                          important to him. Treasures relationships that have
                          been already established. Stubbornly retains the
                          system of relations to which he has already become
                          accustomed. He won’t break established relationships,
                          but neither will he cling to relationships that have
                          outlived themselves. Indifferent to criticism from the
                          outside. Not afraid of a negative attitude directed
                          towards him. With strangers and people who confuse him
                          becomes restrained, internally clams up he doesn’t
                          know how to behave himself around them.

                          LII assesses relationships between people by degree of
                          their ease and lack of constraint. Strives for simple,
                          democratic relations. Heavy, tense relationships take
                          away his energy and make him passive. Most often LII
                          is a gentle and pleasant person, not pushy or
                          domineering. Balanced and self-sustained. Has an
                          critical need for independence and territorial
                          autonomy. Poorly subordinates people to his will and
                          defends his everyday interests. In critical
                          situations, may become indecisive and sluggish.
                          Although he will remain cool, he needs some advice on
                          what to do and how to act. May ignore abuse and
                          pressuring. One cannot achieve anything from him by
                          coercive pressure.

                          Friendliness and positive emotions calm him down. With
                          pleasure he responds to them, becomes sociable and
                          witty. Tries to bring joy for people close to him. At
                          close distance, becomes more positive, cheerful and
                          friendly. His optimism is transferred to people around
                          him. If emotions are negative, then he respond to them
                          only if he considers them valid and reasonable.
                          Otherwise he distances and tries to extinguish them by
                          logical analysis. Expresses his own emotions only when
                          he is at close distance or feels that he is in a
                          familiar environment. Otherwise behaves in a cold and
                          detached manner.

                          At home he is modest and agrees to be satisfied by a
                          minimum of facilities. However, effective care for his
                          health and comfort lifts his spirits and makes him
                          optimistic. When his domestic and financial problems
                          are solved, his energy increases and he takes on
                          resolving the problems that have been postponed until
                          better times. Strives to dress harmoniously, without
                          frills and artificial jewelery. However, he is not
                          quick to find his style. Feels uncomfortable if he is
                          dressed non-functionally, in a way that is not
                          inappropriate for the situation. When he experiences
                          discomfort for a long time, it leads to accumulation
                          of negative emotions. Over time, his patience may
                          burst; all that has been simmering inside may spill
                          over.

                          Good at estimating prospects of new undertakings and
                          projects. Gives advice on how to “fine tune” a new,
                          unusual project, what should be considered in order
                          for it to be successful. However, LII himself is not
                          distinguished by entrepreneurial spirit. In business
                          activity he vacillates, thinks for a long time before
                          he decides on something. Often he is too cautious and
                          inactive at first, then, all of a sudden, starts
                          taking risks hoping for luck. In concrete work, he is
                          either too meticulous and specifies everything to the
                          last detail, or he’s too much in a hurry to finish it
                          soon to start on the next job. Raw result doesn’t
                          baffle him: if needed, he will come back and redo the
                          steps. In areas of ??interest to him, he asks
                          questions on what do people typically do, what
                          technology is in use. Based on this information, he
                          decides how he should act himself. However, he quickly
                          loses acquired work skills.

                          proud of his punctuality and organization. Knows how

                          planned work by the deadline. However, he usually
                          delays in the beginning and accelerates his working
                          pace towards the end. Due to this, the quality or
                          volume of his work may suffer. Has greater chances of

                          save him time. Hates it when time is spent uselessly.

                          and alienation. Sometimes you knowingly doom yourself
                          to loneliness. Try not to be gloomy and morose. Smile
                          and be kind more often, but don’t go too far with this
                          because you’ll find it difficult to turn down people.
                          Carefully select a circle of contacts that are
                          necessary for you to avoid unnecessary strain and

                          by your good judgment and deep understanding. Keep in
                          mind that not everyone is just as adept at analyzing

                          more considerate of the interests of others. Try to go

                  relationships. In the interests of his work can ignore his

                  affections. Does not like uninvited guests and unexpected
                  phone calls. Unlikely to take initiative with unfamiliar
                  people. As a rule, has few friends, limiting his social circle
                  to work colleagues and a few like-minded associates. Poorly
                  versed in how other people relate to him and is thus quite
                  restrained in communication. Hides his impressionability under
                  the mask of austerity. Does not seek to win over the
                  sympathies of others. Prefers to talk about topics that
                  interest him, and ignores or omits anything extraneous. If the
                  topic is of no interest to him, he tries to avoid the

                  when carrying out his work. Can make himself do a job that is
                  uninteresting but required. Dislikes doing several things at
                  once, especially in a hurry. This is a person of his word.
                  Proponent of discipline and order backed up by administrative
                  means rather than by conscience and sense of personal
                  responsibility. He believes that if a person has made a
                  choice, then he or she is fully accountable for this decision.

                  attitude. Poorly tolerates being ordered around. Coolly
                  responds to any external strong-willed pressuring. To sharp
                  criticisms may respond in kind; If necessary, can deliver a
                  reproof. Himself resorts to coercion very rarely, only when

                  Reserved, amiable to an extent, polite, and even-tempered, but
                  rarely becomes very close with anyone, for he easily tires of
                  social interaction. If he is interested in a person, he is
                  able to come into his or her good favor by establishing
                  intellectual contact and intriguing with ideas and new
                  suggestions. Quite private, does not like discussing his
                  personal life and does not allow his feelings to take
                  precedence over the interests of business or personal
                  principles. Although in relation with others he is reserved
                  and distrustful, he is inclined to reciprocate the feelings of
                  another person and show attention to his or her problems.
                  Seeks support in active, lively, and strong-spirited people,
                  who know how to encourage and provide help in business
                  matters. Needs an emotional, optimistically oriented partner
                  who would know how to raise his vitality. But at the slightest
                  infringement of his independence, he retreats into himself,
                  stubbornly defending his principles up to a break up of
                  relations. Allows himself to get directed only by those who
                  can persuade gently and not too aggressively.

                  Enemy of the administrative pressuring and control; considers
                  it obstructive to the development of a person’s potential.
                  Convinced that the main thing in work is not sense of duty but
                  interest in the project. Strives for independence. However, at
                  the same time he is usually disciplined, punctual, and
                  conscientious. Makes up his plans himself and follows them
                  exactly. Usually does not run late to events but makes it in
                  the allotted time.

                  Sometimes he is too categorical in his judgments and
                  intolerant of different points of view. He will not
                  dramatically change his beliefs, conclusions, habits and
                  orientations under the influence of new facts and
                  circumstances. He reviews and changes his former views with
                  much difficulty and sometimes exhibits senseless obstinacy.
                  Due to high self-esteem and a developed sense of dignity, it
                  can be difficult for him to admit to being wrong. All of this
                  does not make him the easiest partner to deal with and creates
                  plenty of interpersonal problems in his life. Internally, he
                  may acutely experience his disappointments, but tries to avoid
                  quarrels out of fear of losing control and losing respect of
                  others. Skeptical and distrustful, but does not show this.
                  Restrained in the expression of his feelings, but when he is
                  in a good mood can liven up the conversation with his humor.

                  Yielding and compliant in matters of everyday life. If he
                  cannot completely avoid household chores and other mundane
                  tasks, he will try to postpone them. Dislikes bureaucracy,
                  having to petition various departments and to prepare
                  documents. Shows inertness in such matters even if he sees
                  that his project is suffering. Tries to rely on the help of
                  others in such cases. Does not always take care of his health,
                  but understands its importance. In treatment of illness lacks
                  in consistency and follow-through. Tries to keep up with
                  latest tastes and prevailing styles, to have a presentable
                  appearance.
