                          LSI studies any matter that occupies him in great
                          depth. He stubbornly and persistently collects
                          information to attain a thorough understanding of the
                          subject. He favorably views well-organized and
                          smoothly functioning systems. Anything that does not
                          fit into the system he rejects as nonsensical. He will
                          regularly check the progress of any venture that
                          interests him. Consistent and operative, strives to do
                          his job well and looks to same from others. Is
                          perceptive of existing hierarchies. Does not take into
                          account personal sentiments when it comes to business.
                          Cannot tolerate when someone takes his things or moves

                          Sober realist: sets only feasible goals for himself
                          and in most cases achieves them. If explanations and
                          warnings did not have any effect can shift to
                          pressuring methods of influence. Knows how to force
                          his opponent into a corner and squeeze him. Stoic: can
                          keep himself in control, tolerant of adversities. Will
                          force himself to do that which is necessary but
                          uninteresting to him. Helps and protects those who are
                          weak and defenseless. Looks after the old and the
                          sick. Can be lone-wolf fighter for justice who keeps a
                          low profile.

                          Reliable in his affections, although it can happen

                          to his own. Uses himself to judge the capabilities of
                          others: “If I can do this, then why not others?”
                          Knowledge gained through direct experience serves as a

                          not take sides. Values intelligent, artistically

                          negative emotions - crying, whims, accusations. It is
                          easier to give in for him than to ignore them.
                          Internally rather touchy and vulnerable, although does

                  A sober realist who knows how to find a way out of difficult

                  Dislikes running too much ahead and is able to patiently wait
                  for the outcome. It is difficult to convince him to change his
                  stances. He is uncompromising in matters that he considers to
                  be important. Prefers to prepare for everything in advance
                  since he doesn’t like improvising; feels uncomfortable with
                  change and instability. Somewhat contradictory and given to

                  vacillations undermine his main orientations. Knows how to

                  Lacks sufficient flexibility in dealing with people and is
                  poor at taking their individual abilities into account. Does

                  he is not sure of whether their feelings are trustworthy.
                  Tolerant of defects of those who are close to him; serves as a
                  reliable support for them. Quickly grows tired of interacting
                  with people; quite tolerant of solitude. Restrained and
                  unobtrusive. The objective matters for him are more important
                  than personal relationships and feelings. Usually a private
                  person who does not readily share his experiences with
                  outsiders. Doesn’t demonstrate what he is feeling: hunger,
                  fear, pain, etc. Tries not to burden others with himself;

                  sources of information. A good researcher of narrow issues.
                  Delves into all the details without dismissing and losing

                  advice about any regulations, about which he is usually
                  informed. In an administrative position, he can establish a
