                          ESI sees how people reveal themselves in
                          communication. He cannot be deceived by pretence of
                          friendliness. He critically assesses the behavior of
                          those around him, but openly expresses his opinions
                          only when he feels offended. Remains insistent on his
                          internal subjective evaluation of a person; it is very
                          difficult to convince him to reconsider and change his
                          views. In public, wears a mask of cold and unemotional
                          person. At first acquaintance sharply divides people
                          into two categories - “his own” and “others”. Others
                          mostly cease to exist for him, but to his own he
                          becomes deeply attached. He is often sharp and
                          uncompromising with strangers, but forgives a lot for
                          those who are in his inner circle. Demonstrates his
                          attitude towards someone by managing psychological
                          distance, first distancing a person, then bringing
                          them closer.

                          ESI does not adapt to his partner but instead he seeks
                          to impose his own line of conduct. Adeptly discerns
                          how much force he needs to apply to exert sufficient
                          pressure on a person. Keeps himself together until he
                          reaches a critical point. If needed, readily defends
                          himself and people close to him. Knows how to teach
                          his offender a lesson, sequentially increasing the
                          amount of pressure on him. Does not rest until he
                          feels that his opponent is confused or fallen in his
                          fighting spirit. Moral victory for him is more
                          important than a physical one. Does not allow himself
                          to be treated unceremoniously or for anyone else to
                          impose their views on him. Won’t allow himself to be
                          intimidated or provoked. Dislikes being coerced into
                          doing something and any unreasonable applications of
                          force. His resistance is usually proportionate to the
                          degree of aggression directed at him.

                          ESI finds it difficult to make sense of conglomeration
                          of vague, original ideas and insights that are not
                          based on established and recognized facts. Feels
                          uneasy in situations that are unpredictable and
                          ambiguous. Observing someone compares his capabilities
                          with his own: “Can I do the same as him?” Either
                          idealizes a person too much, or, on the contrary,
                          completely denies his capabilities. Does not trust
                          those who are boastful, who advertise their talents
                          and abilities. Rarely gives out compliments and
                          praises to others but with pleasure accepts
                          compliments in his address. Will not indulge a
                          talented but self centered and self-satisfied
                          individual. Does not recognize abilities that are not
                          supplemented by labor. Finds it difficult to claim
                          attention himself and promote himself for a job. Waits
                          to be noticed and appreciated for his merits.

                          of action. Evaluates everything from the point of view
                          of common sense and rational self-interest. Forces
                          himself to do what is required of him by his

                          Quickly completes labor-intensive jobs so that he
                          wouldn’t have to return to them again. Likes people

                          new place offers more benefits, but with difficulty
                          abandons his habitual way or life to adapt to new
                          situation. The discomfort that he experiences during
                          such transitions and restructurings is very stressful

                          ESI becomes activated in situations where there is a
                          shortage of time. He is oriented at quick decisions
                          and solutions, otherwise he feels irritated. Being
                          nudged over minor details evokes internal protest in
                          him, but he rapidly mobilizes for significant goals
                          and projects. It is better to not give him much time
                          to prepare; the more time he spends getting ready, the
                          more anxious and worried he grows, and the poorer the
                          result will be. Internally ESI is apprehensive. He
                          thinks about dangers and negative outcomes that
                          threaten him and his relatives. Looks for
                          philosophical and mystical ways of reasoning to attain
                          a sense of protection from the vagaries of fate. Will

                          ready for contingencies. He has a good memory for the
                          mistakes, failures, and shocks of the past, from which
                          he draws lessons for the future.

                          ESI is perceptive of the emotional state of a person.
                          If a person is in a poor mood, he asks about the
                          reasons that caused it, however, he is often incapable
                          of improving another’s mood and alleviating their
                          worries. Instead he adapts himself to the moods of
                          others. In a serious situation he is emphatically
                          formal. Among friends he is casually cheerful, even
                          allowing himself some cynical witticisms. Likes people
                          who are cheerful and energetic, who know how to loosen
                          and relax others, how to reduce tensions and improve
                          the mood, who have confidence in the future. ESI needs
                          a distraction from burdensome negative thoughts and
                          periodic emotional releases. He tries to avoid the
                          drama of life and explosions of negative emotions. He
                          is too aware of the heavy impact these have on one’s
                          psyche and well-being. At times he deliberately
                          accelerates conflicts and dramatize situations to
                          speed up their resolution and settlement.

                          lifestyle. Will not tolerate a person who is
                          physically repulsive to him or is unhealthy in his
                          instincts.

                  Stubborn, firm, and uncompromising in matters that are of
                  importance to him. Strong-willed and enduring. Industrious and
                  venturesome. Energetic and quick in handling practical
                  matters. Can do several things at once, showing extraordinary
                  work ethic and efficiency. From time to time, needs an
                  emotional discharge. Difficult life situations invigorate him
                  and stimulate him to search for quick solutions and exits out
                  of current circumstances. With difficulty takes the initiative
                  in making new acquaintances and establishing new contacts, but
                  usually takes the first steps in breaking off relations that
                  have run their course. Observant and clever, at the right time
                  can hit the weakest spot of his opponent. To good and poor
                  treatment answers with the same. Has a tendency to divide
                  people into “his own” and “others”.

                  Seems somewhat inaccessible, vigilant, and alert. Dislikes it
                  when someone puts his qualities to an evaluation because
                  internally he is not fully confident in himself. Intolerant of
                  those who are lazy, slovenly, and disingenuous. Does not
                  forgive rudeness and tactlessness, which may even serve as a
                  reason to break up relations for him. In a company of
                  unfamiliar or unpleasant people, he feels constrained and may
                  choose to leave quietly. Does not like unexpected visitors,
                  quickly becomes tired of them. At times he is overly
                  distrustful and suspicious of others.

                  In conversation with people tries to determine their abilities
                  and possibilities for future practical application in some
                  area. Tries to evaluate people objectively, regardless of his
                  sympathies for them. Often possesses good administrative
                  skills. In his decisions seeks to rely on factual information.

                  In a circle of close people, he is usually talkative, makes
                  jokes, sometimes asks tricky questions, inclined to play
                  pranks and set up ruses; attempts to entertain others.
                  Subordinates his emotions to the situation: he is cheerful
                  among those who are cheerful and serious among those who are
                  serious. Defends and upholds ethical standards. Selflessly
                  protects his own interests and interest of people who are
                  close to him. Able to make others subjugate to his will. In
                  difficult situations, readily lends his help to others and
                  offers his services. Tries not to show his anger and spite
                  openly, but not everyone can withstand his penetrating,
                  prickly gaze.

                  Places high demands on himself. Quickly adapts to new
                  circumstances if he finds them favorable. Poorly tolerates
                  ambivalence and hesitation. Finds it difficult to wait for
                  resolution of important for him questions. Often fluctuates in
                  selection of a goal, but at a critical moment he can make the
                  right decision. Poorly feels the progression of time; due to
                  this, grows nervous getting ready for anything, feels anxious
                  that he won’t make it on time. Feels worried concerning
                  upcoming changes, for example, when he has to take a trip.
                  Cherishes stability, supports conventions of his own circle.
                  Somewhat suspicious and skeptical.

                  A good economist, able to efficiently handle his finances,
                  dislikes being in debt. Easily takes the initiative in
                  concrete and practical activities, can even be assertive and
                  imposing. Intolerant of irresponsibility and disorganization.
                  Often possesses a developed aesthetic taste and dresses
                  originally. Clean and neat, and demands the same from others.
                  Finds it difficult to discern individual capabilities and
                  hidden motives of others; due to this can have problems with
                  his work colleagues, family members and children.

                  This is a person of duty, very active and enduring.
                  Characterized by expansionism within a small circle. Can be
                  aggressive if he’s not agreed with.

                  In conflict situations is never the first to seek
                  reconciliation. Gravitates to administrative roles. May become
                  managers of medium-sized groups, keeping discipline and order,
                  and applying sanctions to those who are at fault.

                  Businesslike and purposeful. Can give a rebuff to those who
                  create illegal structures, as they easily recognize the seeds
                  of such activities.
