                          The SEI is a person of habitual pleasures and simple
                          joys of life. Very considerate of habits and
                          conveniences of other people. Won’t trespass on
                          someone else’s calm state. Shows concern for the
                          health and well-being of people close to him.
                          Surrounds himself with little pleasant things. Dresses
                          simply and in good taste. Rejects extremes in
                          appearance. Generally stays out of the limelight -
                          doesn’t distinguish himself as the best, but neither
                          will he lag behind. Knows how to get along with many
                          different people, as he’s usually takes the middle
                          position. Explores the world of objects - likes to
                          take an object into his hands, to touch it, to sense
                          its physical qualities. For a long time remembers his
                          impressions. Easily manipulates and works with
                          objects, gravitating towards those things which are at
                          least somewhat familiar to him.

                          Understands the reasons and causes for people’s
                          emotions. Knows how to cheer up or to anger a
                          particular person. In communication of informal
                          nature, SEI is usually friendly, demonstrates
                          optimism. Loves to have fun in a close circle of
                          friends. Seeks to cheer up others with jokes, hints,
                          allusions, and pranks. Considers different ways of
                          getting positive emotions. Prefers to abstain from
                          disputes and controversies, as he wishes to get along
                          with everyone. Collects various stories, rumors,
                          sensational or otherwise interesting information, and
                          shares them with his friends. He’s usually aware of
                          the social happenings of his circle.

                          SEI’s movements seem non-hurried, measured, gradual.
                          Interacting with others, he doesn’t spare his time,
                          knows how to prolong pleasant meetings and
                          conversations. Does not like people who are always
                          busy, always in a hurry. Has good memory for holiday
                          dates, birthday days of his relatives and friends, and
                          does not forget to congratulate them in time. Time
                          usually works for him: that which he can’t do now, he
                          will make up in the future. Dislikes being tied to
                          deadlines, neither is he distinguished by punctuality.
                          Does everything at a pace that is most convenient to
                          him. Will always find reasons for being late. Delays
                          with making the final decision until the last minute.
                          Internally, the SEI is quite changeable and
                          vacillating person. He needs to be encouraged and
                          prodded to start and finish his work on time.

                          Works productively if other people are waiting for his
                          assistance. Very much needs for his efforts to get
                          noticed and appreciated. If he is not praised, if the
                          results of his work are not distinguished by positive
                          relations, he feels offended internally, though may
                          not show this. Industrious person. With pleasure takes
                          on the role of obtaining and providing the necessary
                          supplies, furnishing any space. Tries exceptionally
                          hard before administrative checks or receptions of
                          guests or visitors. Resourceful and active in
                          designing and setting up his own living space. Likes
                          to experiment in this area, to come up with something
                          of his own. Solves business questions through friends
                          and acquaintances, through informal channels. The more
                          enterprising and venturesome he is, the more ties and
                          connections he makes. However, his natural laziness
                          puts a limit to the number of his contacts. Keeps only
                          those contacts that bring him some benefit. Very
                          attached to his occupation, his field of activity. Has
                          a hard time changing professions and disrupting his
                          habitual rhythm of work.

                          The SEI poorly tolerates monotony. He needs
                          alternatives to boring everyday life, a possibility to
                          make a choice. Greatly enjoys himself if he finds a
                          way out of dead-end, seemingly hopeless situations.
                          Interested in unusual and extraordinary people who
                          have many ideas and make bold proposals. Boring,
                          mundane people strain him; he tries to avoid their
                          company. He is tolerant of eccentrics and inventors,
                          all those people who are “not of this world”. He views
                          them like children, looks after them graciously
                          forgiving their antics.

                          The SEI receives and understands chaotic information
                          poorly. It makes him confused, throws him off track,
                          may even spoil his mood. The SEI likes it when someone
                          makes a connections between specific events and
                          general concepts. His self-esteem improves from
                          becoming aware of his own usefulness, that without him
                          it won’t do. Likes to correspond to the place or role
                          allotted to him. Activates when he is given a clear
                          goal and explained the trajectory of action. Ways of
                          achieving it he will find himself. Doesn’t need “bare”
                          facts, instructions, explanations. The main thing for
                          him is to like the system, that it would evoke a
                          positive response in him. Then he becomes collected
                          and organized.

                          The SEI is dependent on how the forces have been
                          distributed in a given situation. Capable of
                          foreseeing possible hostility or acts of aggression,
                          disturbances in balance of power, the loss of
                          stability. Critical of people who are sluggish, inert,
                          apathetic. Tries to mobilize them, to make them
                          active, calls them to take decisive and rapid action.
                          Sensitively reacts to volitional pressuring. In a
                          crude, power-oriented situation responds with
                          analogous degree of aggressiveness. Won’t allow
                          himself to be abused, or for someone to take advantage
                          of his generally agreeable nature. Knows when to put
                          pressure and when to ease up, but does not seek to
                          control anyone. The burden of power for him is too
                          heavy load to carry. It is enough for him to be able
                          to defend his own interests.

                          and helpful. Demonstrates his sympathies not by word
                          but by deeds. The SEI feels uncomfortable to demand or
                          seek something for himself. He feels much more

                          yourself to do uninteresting, difficult, but necessary
                          work. You dislike formal settings, prefer to negotiate

                  Attentive and caring towards other people, considerate of

                  Inquisitive, collects various information and shares it with
                  others. Critically evaluates what he hears. Does not like
                  exaggeration, hype - needs facts and justifications. He enjoys

                  and avoids serious quarrels. In business matters prefers to
                  negotiate at an informal level. Knows how to patiently
                  persuade a person to take on a beneficial or profitable
                  project, but doesn’t always notice which undertakings are
                  actually promising. Thus, he can be hesitant in starting on
                  new projects, afraid of making mistakes and feeling at fault.
                  Values his peace and knows how to move away from any sources

                  Tries under any circumstances to not lose his sense of
                  measure. Keeps neutral in debates. Amiable, will try to find a
                  method to find rapport with most. Even when he has to insist
                  on and defend his own opinions, he is able to maintain good
                  relations. Often acts as a peacekeeper, trying to convince
                  other people to agree to a compromise and come to mutual
                  accord. Doesn’t find it easy to deny a person’s request, to
                  push someone away, thus is often careful at the beginning of a
                  conversation, and dislikes people who are “sticky” and
                  intrusive. With difficulty determines what a person is capable
                  of and what to expect from him, though he appreciates talented
                  and original individuals. Usually does not criticize anyone
                  and dislikes it when other people are criticized in his
                  presence. May be impatient as a listener. Does not like to
                  compete or to coerce others into doing things against their
                  own will. Has difficulties asserting and defending the
                  interest of his business matters if he is unable to find
                  agreement on an informal level.

                  aesthetics in any manifestation. Gravitates towards pleasant
                  experiences. Dresses tastefully. Has an inclination for
                  following the latest styles. Loves comfort and aesthetics,
                  various original decorations. Industrious, loves doing
                  something with his hands. Everything that he takes up does
                  with a sense of taste investing his heart and soul. Does not
                  like commitments and giving promises, since he is afraid that
                  he won’t be able to fulfill them. On some he can make an
                  impression of a passive and inert person, since he doesn’t see
                  the point in empty hassle and pointless expenditure of
                  efforts. Due to this, often acquires the reputation of a
                  talented slouch, who takes up a philosophical, contemplative
                  stance in life. Strives for good quality of life.

                  others with his requests, asks for help only in extreme cases.
                  Generally, will not attempt to draw attention to himself when
                  he feels that nobody is interested in him. Dislikes talking
                  about his failures. By nature private, sensitive, and easily
                  wounded. Turns for help only to people who are close to him
                  and who have proven themselves. Hospitable, likes when food is
                  cooked deliciously and served with appeal. If he is to receive
                  important guests or visitors, spends a lot of time and effort
                  on such occasions, and thus rarely agrees to such events.

                  Very appreciative of the joy of human interaction and all the
                  other pleasures of life. Skilled in his ability to do pleasant
                  things and aims to provide enjoyment for himself and for
                  others. As a rule he is helpful, friendly, sympathetic, and
                  considerate. Often the soul of the company. Hospitable, often
                  knows how to cook well. Creates a relaxed, informal, trustful
                  atmosphere of communication. Cares for and attends to others
                  with elegance and ease, readily gives out compliments,
                  uplifting their mood and the general atmosphere. Able to cheer
                  people up with jokes and ruses. If he sees that someone is
                  growing angry, he quickly smooths out the bad impression of a
                  failed joke thus preventing a potential conflict.

                  Usually has many acquaintances, but fully relaxes and enjoys
                  himself only in a circle of close friends. Tries not to go
                  where he is not wanted. With unfamiliar people he is somewhat
                  cautious and reserved. Does not like people who are cold and
                  arrogant, with whom he cannot create an atmosphere of intimacy
                  and informality. Becomes anxious when he is dealing with
                  someone who is unpleasant to him; in such cases his speech at
                  times becomes hurried and indistinct. Not prone to
                  insubordination; avoids his superiors and boring strictly
                  business conversations. If he is feeling sick or is in a bad
                  mood, he retreats not wanting to burden others with his
                  problems.

                  Trying to lift the mood and vitality of those around him, he
                  assumes a position that he is sincerely indignant at their
                  passivity and inaction. If his cheers and jokes have no
                  effect, he is able to prick with a word such that it finally
                  gets him the desired reaction. Sometimes, in the interest of
                  the matter, he assumes a harsh and severe look. In such cases
                  it is difficult to understand whether he is joking or being
                  serious. Well versed in the nuances of feelings of others and
                  willingly demonstrates his own, due to which he is usually
                  popular among the opposite sex.

                  Internally inconsistent and very dependent on his state. Pays
                  attention to problems and tries to resolve them as soon as
                  possible; cannot stand uncertainty and doubt. Impatient, finds
                  it difficult to wait for the natural outcome of events,
                  prefers to speed things up. He is inclined to make hasty
                  decisions and take reckless actions. Clever and resourceful,
                  does not lose himself under any circumstances. Quickly notices
                  weaknesses and deficiencies of a person or a situation and can
                  depict them in a humorous light. Tries to create and cultivate
                  useful ties and contacts, but sometimes doesn’t have enough
                  tolerance and diplomacy.

                  Plays the role of someone without problems. Sufficiently
                  optimistic. Failures for him seem like they do not deserve
                  attention. Leads an active way of life. When occupied by some
                  business matter, sometimes he fusses and hustles, even though
                  actual business activity lends itself to him with difficulty.
                  Cannot occupy with one thing for a long time. Often changes
                  his hobbies and occupations, tries his hand at various
                  activities. He does not like meticulous sedentary work, but
                  willingly takes on an interesting to him assignment and
                  carries it out with great enthusiasm. However, may also
                  suddenly lose interest and grow cold and not carry it through.
                  Often frustrates other people with his disorganization, but
                  it’s difficult to remain angry at him.
