                          The EIE encompasses and manages a very wide range of
                          emotional states. Dramatic emotions quickly turn into
                          comic ones or interweave together, however, in company
                          of strangers and unfamiliar people he can behave
                          calmly and hold himself with dignity. Endowed with the
                          gift of emotional empathy, can experience emotions of
                          another person as if they were his own. Expressive in
                          gestures, gaze, intonation, and other emotional
                          expressions. A good actor or speaker. Continually
                          reinvents and reincarnates himself in some style.
                          Often aggravates the situation and welcomes the
                          emotional tension that comes with this. People in his
                          proximity may find it difficult to dealing with his
                          type of emotional pressuring. The EIE cannot find
                          peace and serenity himself; he or she overflows with
                          negative emotions, which can lead to emotional and
                          mental breakdowns.

                        <div class="paragraph">
                          The EIE is very perceptive of development of
                          situations over time. Sensing a potentially negative
                          situation upcoming, he prepares for it in advance and
                          thinks about alternative solutions and ways out. Warns
                          others about the risks they may face. Often wavers and
                          experiences doubt and hesitation, which makes it
                          difficult for him to make important decisions.
                          However, once the decision has been made, he will not
                          hesitate any longer and will not look back.
                          Internally, the EIE is very contradictory. He is
                          attuned to inconsistencies between what people say and
                          what they do, conflicts and hypocrisy. Often
                          interested in topics related to destiny, fate, and
                          other mysterious phenomena. Over time, his worldviews
                          may change to something diametrically opposite of what
                          he has previously believed.

                        <div class="paragraph">
                          Likes being involved in projects that bring about
                          concrete benefits. He does quality work and does not
                          like to go back and redo anything. Enjoys challenging
                          himself and mastering difficult disciplines. By
                          temperament impatient and restless. Sitting in one
                          place for a long time can even lead to muscle spasms.
                          Finds it difficult to relax even when he is sleeping.
                          Usually has superior organizational skills, however,
                          becomes depleted by prolonged business activity. Gives
                          others a lot of small tasks, but has no time to keep
                          track of everything and becomes stressed by this. Has
                          a hard time working while being watched. Any quick
                          movements and sudden noises irritate him, however,
                          constant mild background sounds often improve his
                          efficiency.

                          EIE often feels uneasy about any physical ailments and
                          suffering. Has difficulty getting rid of bad habits.
                          In sexual matters, often falls to extremes: from
                          indifference to perversion. Pays much attention to his
                          own appearance, especially surface aesthetics that can
                          bring him much joy or disappointment. In nutrition, he
                          is capriciously selective and may combine products of
                          opposing tastes. Can be quite unpretentious with food,
                          only care that it is provided for regularly. Estimates
                          attitudes of others by how much they are willing to do
                          for him and how tolerant they are of his strange
                          tastes and habits. Does not feel well in confined
                          spaces. May choose the life of a recluse.

                        <div class="paragraph">
                          EIE is in need of a certain level of organization and
                          order around himself, the absence of which can even
                          affect his physical well-being. Living within some
                          framework of a strict system does much good for him.
                          Uncertainty, unpredictability, and constant changes of
                          schedule have poor effect on his health. He is very
                          keen on catching the slightest deviation from the
                          usual scheme of events. Relaxes over meticulous
                          studies that require concentration. In his conclusions
                          is often rather subjective and often makes
                          generalizations that sound one-sided. He likes
                          systematic logic. Seeks to streamline everything, to
                          limit it with what seems to him as a reasonable a
                          framework and rules, however, can make exceptions for
                          himself.

                        <div class="paragraph">
                          At times he vigorously protests against use of coarse
                          force and brutality. Often strives for courteous and
                          helpful conduct towards people, but in a fit of
                          passion won’t stop at anything. His own strength
                          increases dramatically in an extreme situation (e.g.
                          panic, confusion). In such cases, he behaves
                          confidently. However, he becomes helpless to counter
                          an inappropriate use force if he has been emotionally
                          and spiritually broken. In such situations he resigns
                          to fate as to an inevitability. Only use of direct
                          force can snap him out of hysterical state of being. A
                          sudden strike sobers him up from his emotional
                          excesses. He is in need of external help to contain
                          his uncontrollable emotions and reduce the grip that
                          they have on him.

                          EIE is often not sure of the durability of his
                          relationships with other people. Thus he seeks a
                          constant verbal or other kind of reassurance. He
                          treats his contestants with much jealousy and is
                          capable of predicting the development of their
                          relationships over time. Criticizes the manners and
                          philosophical view points of others. Himself is either
                          a loyal and devoted partner or a Don Juan. His sore
                          spot is the reliability of relations with people whom
                          he trusts. Those who have once misled him he does not
                          forgive. He is quick to take offense and can be
                          vindictive. Prefers to keep at a distance from people.
                          Often will greatly lower his own worth in the eyes of
                          others, but is given into extremes and can as well
                          narcissistically inflate and obsess over other people.

                          solutions to the problems. Will often take an
                          uncompromising centrist stance on issues that he
                          perceives as only secondary. Looks for the most
                          complex and exciting enterprises. Worries a lot if he
                          is criticized because he perceives this as a defeat of
                          his ideals. Has an innate feeling of own inferiority
                          for which he compensates by demonstrative behaviors.

                  that he later regrets. Can be inconsistent and unpredictable
                  in his actions. Courageous and decisive in extreme situations.
