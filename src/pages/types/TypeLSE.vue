                          The LSE is an assertive, energetic, hard-working
                          person. Spends many hours each day working, as much as
                          his work requires. Supporter of good quality,
                          reliability, and productivity of labor. Searches for
                          bold, innovative and unconventional technical
                          solutions. Inclined towards rationalizing activities.
                          Skillfully uses instruments and exploits technologies.
                          Has an extremely practical turn of mind. Makes all of
                          his evaluations from the point of view of feasibility
                          and utility. Prudent and thrifty manager. Foresees the
                          best ways to manage and utilize objects at his
                          disposal. Makes preparations and provisions for the
                          future. Teaches people how to live wisely, how to not
                          waste their capabilities in vain.

                          A very caring person. Ensures that his loved ones have
                          an income and comfortable living conditions. Helps
                          people not by words, but by deeds. Spends his vacation
                          time resting as thoroughly as he was working. Loves
                          holiday dinners, abundant food, often knows how to
                          cook well himself. With pleasure gives gifts and
                          presents surprises. Goes through physical weakness and
                          ailments with difficulty, neglects his own illnesses.
                          Often looks after health of others more willingly than
                          after his own well-being. For him it’s important to
                          find the original cause of poor health. Usually looks
                          tidy and neat and handles his belongings with care.
                          Won’t immediately use a new costume or clothing set,
                          but instead will preserve it for the right occasion.
                          Prefers strict business or classical styles. Pays
                          particular attention to the cleanliness of shoes.

                          In communication, the LSE seeks to show kindness and
                          sense of humor. Demonstrates his good predisposition
                          and positive emotions, though sometimes does so too
                          abruptly. Becomes very hot tempered during arguments
                          and disputes. When he is overtaken by emotions, he no
                          longer hears the opinions of others and stubbornly
                          insists on his own view point. Never openly admits
                          that he was wrong. However, if a person remains
                          discreet and restrained, and does not submit to his
                          pressuring, he becomes more attentive and cautious.
                          Can curb and restrain his own emotions by willful
                          effort as well. Very much dislikes it when someone
                          else interferes in his affairs or forces him to redo
                          his work. At such times can flare up, start throwing
                          objects, sharply turn around and leave.

                          The LSE assesses relations by another’s ability to
                          keep his word, to warn of their intent in timely
                          manner, to be punctual and come at appointed time.
                          Appreciates those who do not spare their time for him.
                          Tries to prepare for everything in advance. Sudden
                          changes of plans that occur without a warning annoy
                          and anger him. Dislikes answering questions of the
                          kind “What will happen tomorrow?”, “When are you going
                          to do that?”, etc. The Very much in need of a
                          guaranteed future and predictability of events.
                          Dislikes radical changes and abrupt deviations from
                          the planned course. Prefers to move forward in a
                          straight line. Poorly foresees dangers and obstacles.
                          Usually respects established traditions and customs.
                          However, also strives to keep up with the modern times
                          and won’t cling too strongly to the old ways.

                          LSE’s mood and state are dependent on the prevailing
                          surrounding psychological atmosphere. If people around
                          him quarrel, fight, distrust one another, his own
                          state rapidly deteriorates. Very stable in personal
                          ties. For those who reciprocate his feelings does a
                          lot more than they were expecting. Needs relationships
                          that are deep and strong. Likes long, heartfelt
                          conversations, and stories about various ways of
                          spending one’s time. Despite his external sharpness
                          and rough edges, deep inside the LSE is quite
                          sentimental. However, it is difficult to become close
                          with him due to his high demands towards his partners.

                          LSE’s own creative abilities become manifest when he
                          is in a good mood. If he feels that the conceived is
                          in principle possible, then he will proceed to the
                          implementation of plans with much enthusiasm and zeal.
                          Cannot live without a purpose, without some clear
                          prospects before him. The achievement of each
                          intermediate result inspires him and instills desire
                          to continue on and go the full distance. Enjoys
                          competition, games, dynamic types of sports.
                          Adventurous. Becomes more engaged and inspired if
                          there is a need to prove his abilities. When he loses
                          orientation or sees no solutions, becomes nervous,
                          agitated, loses his spirit. In such situations, he
                          needs advice, calm support, or the correction of the
                          end goal.

                          The LSE cannot live in chaos and disarray. Fights
                          against lack of discipline, violation of norms and
                          rules. Himself gives a personal example of good
                          discipline and organization, but doesn’t have enough
                          strength to ensure this in others. Collects all the
                          relevant information before he starts on anything
                          serous. Cannot act in unsystematic, blind manner.
                          Intolerant of trickery, hoaxes, wily schemes.
                          Expresses his negative opinions rather directly.
                          Critical in evaluating work, his own and that of
                          others. Finds it difficult to explain the technology
                          of some steps or actions, since systematic-analytical
                          type of thinking is not his strong point. Instead of
                          giving instructions prefers the method of “do as I
                          do”. Tries to move from words and get down to business
                          as soon as possible.

                          often find yourself overloaded with tasks, chores, and
                          work that appear seemingly from nowhere, and require
                          time to prepare for important events. You have
                          difficulty foreseeing approaching danger or failure in
                          business. Unexpected turns of events that you could
                          not foresee frustrate and unnerve you, knock you out
                          of balance. You find it difficult to spend much time
                          waiting for the outcome of any undertaking, especially
                          if there’s little confidence in its success.

                          You are recommended to frequently review your views on

                          and unworkable traditions and habits. Dry logic of
                          facts should not suppress in you the appreciation of

                          conservatism and stubbornness. More often compare
                          yourself to others, cultivate flexibility in your ways

                          close ones, that at the same time you behave with
