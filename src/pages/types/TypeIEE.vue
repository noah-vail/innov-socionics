                          The IEE (ENFp) has an excellent intuition for people.
                          He adeptly assesses motivation of others from
                          disparate phrases, intonation, facial expressions, and
                          peculiarities of behavior. Easily guesses what another
                          person is striving for. Learns quickly, for he is able
                          to grasp the main points of the issue. Has
                          well-developed faculties of fantasy: often thinks up
                          stories with entertaining plot lines, creates
                          imaginary scenes and events, easily envisions and
                          conceptualizes. Gravitates towards talented and
                          unusual personalities. Knows how to encourage and
                          inspire people, generously gives compliments,
                          enthusiastically describes future activities and
                          prospects. Offers multiple solutions for addressing
                          the same problem. Finds it unbearable to occupy
                          himself with repetitive work; repetition generates
                          boredom which strongly depresses his spirits.

                          IEE, like no other, is discerning in the logic of
                          human relations, especially acutely he sees the causes
                          and motivations that create complications and
                          conflicts in intimate relationships and friendships.
                          It is easier for him, however, to maintain the present
                          relations that are running smoothly than to mend old
                          breakups. He sensitively reacts to any antipathies and
                          animosity. Charming and sociable; will build relations
                          with anyone, if this person is interesting to him.
                          Perceptive of which distance he needs to keep with
                          which individual in social interaction, although he
                          doesn’t always hold it. IEE knows what needs to be
                          done to maintain a favorable psychological atmosphere
                          within a group. He gives advice on how to interact and
                          communicate with someone to become invaluable to them.

                        <div class="paragraph">
                          In extreme situations, IEE mobilizes and acts quite
                          resolutely and decisively. Provides a rebuff and
                          resistance to any types of encroachment and invasions.
                          He will respond to any dictatorial and coercive
                          attempts and retaliate with force. Very independent,
                          but also won’t attempt to compel and drive others. Not
                          afraid to speak out against a superior force. He can
                          go to an official or a manager of any rank and demand
                          a resolution or implementation of measures to address
                          his problems. When he gets involved in arguments, IEE
                          will actively and sometimes aggressively assert his
                          opinions and views. Suffers from irritability and
                          edginess. For this reason often has trouble with
                          building up bodily tension.

                          IEE is unable to work effectively within a rigid
                          system that imposes too many restrictions. He dislikes
                          it when his relations with others are controlled and
                          regulated from the outside. Find it difficult to
                          perform meticulous work of the type of formal
                          accounting. He often doesn’t go into the details but
                          will instead grasp the general meaning. Due to this,
                          he doesn’t always listen to another person to the very
                          end before coming to a conclusion and voicing his
                          advice, which results in others feeling misunderstood.
                          In his reasoning and formulation of objective
                          conclusions, he often errs on the side of subjective
                          impressions and subjective ethics and may ignore or
                          dismiss the facts that contradict his own personal
                          impressions. Though he will put in an effort and take
                          objective factors into account in cases when he
                          doesn’t want to leave a poor impression of himself.

                          IEE is able to fully relax only in a thoroughly
                          comfortable environment where he can feel himself at
                          home and not worry about complications. He needs
                          substantial doses of pleasant experiences; personal
                          enjoyment plays a big role in his life. He loves it
                          when he is surrounded by comfort, domestic coziness,
                          help and care shown in concrete actions. Due to his
                          preference for this kind of leisure, sometimes he
                          makes an impression of a superficial, high-spirited
                          and carefree person. It is possible for him to get
                          sucked into the vortex of pleasant life which could
                          lead to unpleasant consequences. He doesn’t take care
                          much of himself and can do with very little, however,
                          physical and emotional discomfort will eventually
                          undermine his health. He seeks the kind of lifestyle
                          that isn’t be too heavily burdened with contention and
                          the need to fight for one’s existence.

                          His internal state and mood are dependent upon the
                          nature of work that he has to do. If it’s not
                          interesting or seems useless, then his mood drops. For
                          this reason, IEE is not prone to performing regular
                          upkeep and maintenance of his living quarters. He has
                          weak sense of pragmatism and is not economical. If he
                          becomes involved in organizing something, he does it
                          out of his creative interest, for the soul, for the
                          idea, and not for profit. The best reward for his
                          labor is admiration, excitement and conveyance of
                          positive emotions. The interplay of connecting
                          pleasure with business constitutes a large part of
                          IEE’s life - he tries to turn work or studying into a
                          kind of a game.

                          time. At the same time, often he poorly manages his
                          own time and is prone to tardiness. When explaining or
                          telling others about something, he follows his own

                          fit into the allotted time. For Advisor, it is
                          important to monitor the ongoing development of the
                          situation. Without inspiration and hope, without
                          changes for the better, he feels depressed. Easily
                          believes in optimistic promises, even though he
                          understands that major changes take a while to
                          implement. He himself is not characterized by

                          sad emotions. In order to escape and distract himself,
                          can bury himself in work. In this he often doesn’t
                          feel a sense of measure and can overwork himself. In
                          communication, he is emotional, independent, and
                          somewhat naive. However, these qualities help him to
                          achieve success in seemingly hopeless or very
                          difficult undertakings. In a good mood, he effectively
                          resolves the current operational difficulties and
                          obstructions. He quickly finds how to substitute a
                          missing item, or even how to completely do without it

                          regulations, to carefully maintain records, to work in
                          very close quarters with many people, to respect the
                          official chain of command regardless of individual
                          qualities of people in leadership.

                          It is difficult for you to provide a dispassionate

                          secondary, due to which you tend to drown in pointless
                          unfruitful affairs and numerous hobbies spreading

                          allocate events in time, which ultimately leads to
                          physical and nervous exhaustion and dissatisfaction

                          mostly to people, while in business it will do you
                          good to listen to the advice of the experts. Read more
                          and read thoughtfully, write down the most important
                          rules and information. Remember that to move forward
                          you’ll need more than improvisation, enthusiasm, and

                          Your other weak spot is underdeveloped ability to

                  Very perceptive. Has a good sense for hidden motivations of

                  various human weaknesses. Friendly and responsive, sympathizes
                  with people, likes giving them advice in difficult life
                  situations. Always see several varied solutions to the

                  Discerning of people’s abilities. Gravitates towards talented
                  and extraordinary personalities. Likes new experiences and
                  impressions. Interested in all that is unusual and mysterious.
                  Curious, reads much and reflects. This is a creative
                  personality. Analyzes everything - tries to understand the
                  essence of different phenomena. Feels bored if he doesn’t find
                  a use for his abilities: from routine his vitality wanes.
                  Tends to periodically change jobs or his hobbies, to test
                  himself in a new pursuits, until he finds an occupation that
                  he sincerely enjoys. He is constantly experimenting, looking
                  for new directions and approaches in his work. He is very
                  demanding towards himself and towards others in creative
                  sense. Always can find flaws and faults and is therefore never
                  completely happy with what has been done. Becoming inspired by
                  any idea becomes its active supporter. Persistently promotes
                  and develops it, not sparing his time and efforts.

                  Has a holistic, global approach to solving problems.
                  Difficulties do not frighten him, but in the reverse they
                  attract him. When he starts on one thing, he sees everything
                  that is somehow related to it. Experiences difficulties in
                  connection this, when there is a need to select the main
                  important aspects and push aside all those secondary. Tries to
                  finish the whole load of assignments and chores at once, as a
                  result of which he overworks himself and loses faith in their
                  own strengths. In such cases, needs a long rest and to focus
                  his attention on something else. After this, gets back to work
                  with renewed enthusiasm and completes his assignments. Cannot
                  stand when he is subjected to a strict work schedule or when
                  someone tightly manages his activities. Prefers to have
                  independence that would allow him to live freely, by his own
                  schedule, and to retain his individuality.

                  Demonstrates follow-through with his projects and interests
                  others with them. His faith in success, even in the most
                  hopeless cases, gets passed on to those around him, while his
                  enthusiasm is able to shake the confidence of even the most
                  hardened skeptics. Passionately defends his beliefs. If he is
                  confident in his correctness, exerts strong emotional pressure
                  on others, disregarding any authorities. Quickly notices weak
                  spots of his opponent and can easily put him into a dead end.
                  But grows tired from discussions quickly. Prefers to
                  communicate with like-minded people, and thus creates a social
                  circle around himself of people who have similar views and are
                  sympathetic towards each other.

                  Able to see ahead, has a good sense for future development and
                  prospect of affairs and relations. Perceives danger ahead of
                  time, and tries to take measures to eliminate it in advance.
                  Surprises people around him by his gift of prescience, as his
                  predictions often come true. Having many options and choices
                  of solutions, experiences difficulty with taking initiative.
                  Unsure of himself, and especially in his own volitional
                  qualities. Suffers due to his scatteredness and
                  disorganization, and inertia of his character. Doesn’t know
                  how to protect his material and financial interests. However,
                  in extreme situations he is decisive, determined, cool-headed
                  and discerning, instantly orients, showing courage and

                  Reacts sensitively to rudeness, cruelty, injustice. Can lose
                  his temper and flare up. Doesn’t always control himself in his
                  words and actions. Calming down, tries to rectify the
                  situation, especially if he feels himself in the wrong.
                  Otherwise doesn’t compromise. Very impressionable and
                  vulnerable. For a long time cannot get out of a stressed
                  state. Even after many years, remembers what he had lived
                  through and experienced down to the minutest details. Being
                  disappointed in a person, forever crosses him out of his life.
                  Not vindictive in little things. Able to forgive a lot to
                  those whom he loves and respects.

                  Tries to be responsible and keep his obligations, to not let
                  others down. Might not keep his word only due to easily
                  getting distracted. Does not like to make promises if he is
                  not confident that he can fulfill them. Sometimes does more
                  than what is expected of him. Dislikes being in debt, having
                  to ask for help, to impose himself or show vested interests.
                  Strives to keep his appearance, his living space and his
                  workplace in order, but this comes to him only with great
                  effort. Impractical and yielding in everyday household
                  matters, modest and undemanding towards items, but strives to
                  look attractive, sometimes even extravagant. Doesn’t know how
                  to take care of himself, but is in big need of both personal
                  and physical comfort. Poorly tolerates overcrowdeding, large
                  crowds of people, as well as absence of aesthetics in any of
                  its manifestations.
