                          The ILE (ENTp) has a variety of interests, gets
                          interested almost in everything in hopes of finding
                          something unique and original. Clearly sees the
                          promise of new ideas and projects. Quickly rejects
                          ideas that have proven to be futile and switches to
                          something new. Often has hobbies that are not related
                          to his main occupation. Strives to collect all
                          discoveries and innovations on a problem or question
                          that is of interest to him. Persistent and expansive
                          in dissemination of his own developments. To “light
                          up” with an idea he needs to make it “his own”.
                          Generates bold, alternative ideas on any topic he is
                          faced with. If the business or work that he has to
                          occupy himself don’t interest him, will give it a
                          completely new turn. Can offer many applications for
                          an invention or discovery. Poorly tolerates routine
                          and shackles of tradition.

                          concepts or logical theories. Compares different
                          systems to each other. Clarifies relationships between
                          different schemes or structures. It’s important for
                          him to find causal relationships between specific
                          aspects and the overall general scheme. If an idea
                          doesn’t match the compiled by him design, he is able
                          to change it and present it in such a way that it will
                          fit into the needed framework. Performs complex
                          analysis of any problem, analyzing it from several
                          sides. Explains in what situations or cases one or

                          alike a construction toy, putting them together from
                          already available components or parts. Connects
                          interesting observations or conclusions to his own
                          theories. Seeks to find one comprehensive explanation
                          to disparate phenomena.

                          By nature he is not aggressive, but will actively
                          defend his way of life and his ideas. Boisterously
                          reacts to any attempts to subordinate him to
                          unreasonable, in his view, limitations or rules. If
                          volitional pressure is exerted on him, he immediately
                          goes on a brief, but very strong counter-attack. While
                          at this, he grows so excited that for a period of time
                          loses control over his own actions. Although he can
                          respond to a challenge, he doesn’t endure prolonged
                          confrontation, because he cannot keep himself in a
                          mobilized state for a long time. Therefore, he avoids
                          direct confrontations.

                          Interacts with other people at short psychological
                          distances. Evaluates relations by level of their
                          democratism. The less there is of formalism and
                          ceremoniousness, the better for him. Can be quite
                          inconsistent in relations with his family and friends.
                          At first he is democratic down to familiarity, then
                          suddenly stern and unapproachable, as if they are
                          strangers. In a conversation tries to get all
                          attention of a conversation partner. May gesticulate
                          avidly, speak in a loud tone, fiddle with some object
                          in his hands, and even touch his conversation
                          companions. Can selflessly provide assistance to
                          people who come to him for his help. He finds it very
                          difficult to introduce damaging notes into his
                          relationships by denying a person a chance to
                          communicate with him. Feels his own connectedness and
                          responsibility through his relationships with other
                          people. Does not hesitate to share his personal

                          to smell. To get a sense of taste of food or beverages
                          needs to try out a considerable portion. Easily spends
                          not concerning with saving or stocking up. Places his
                          own convenience in the first place. Doesn’t give any
                          attention to organization and order around himself.
                          Leaves things where he has last used them, then spends
                          much time looking for them. Interested in topics of
                          health and sickness. If he gets sick, may take higher
                          doses of medication, seek radical treatments. However,
                          does not take up daily preventative measures.
                          Maintains his vitality by using external stimulants.
                          His external appearance is often sloppy, untidy. Wears
                          clothes poorly, it quickly wears out. Dislikes changes
                          in the surrounding environment when he is used to it.

                          Loves company, parties, emotional communication. If
                          he’s not charged by positive emotions, remains in a
                          lazy apathetic state for a long time. Always ready for
                          an active exchange of opinions and views, interesting
                          debates and arguments. To emotion responds with
                          emotion, thus it’s important not to overdo it with the
                          degree of engagement, else in a gust of inspiration he
                          will forget the starting point of disagreement. If
                          he’s in an emotionally excited state, he talks rapidly
                          and chaotically. His thoughts begin to overtake their
                          expression in words, and from this his speech becomes
                          unintelligible. Occasionally has sharp changes of
                          mood. Noise, humor, activity, cheerfulness alternate
                          with depression and uncommunicability.

                          objective, observable actions. Then you will be able

                          and straightforwardness. By this you can acquire

                          lose track of daily chores and upkeep tasks, which may

                  Needs periodic emotional shake-ups. Feels delighted to have

                  provocative humor. Poorly sees how people relate to him.
                  Afraid to show his feelings first and doubts them for a long
                  time. Dislikes rushing things. Due to this, may manifest
                  initiative with much delay, when the opportunity is already

                  Does not hurry with the implementation of plans or ideas,

                  Occasionally suffers from disorganization, lack of will and
                  initiative. At times he will rush his work, attempting to make
                  up for lost time. Resourceful and inventive in difficult
                  situations. When at rest, shows little initiative, unless he
                  is faced with a crisis situation, which stimulates him and
                  increases his vitality. Then he begins to actively engage in
                  work, he promptly carries out his assignments not sparing time
                  or resources. Dislikes routine and any regimented, monotonous
                  work. Cannot live by a strict schedule.

                  His character combines qualities of kindness, idealism, and
                  trusting nature. Because of his innate impracticality and
                  gullibility, he can be easily fooled. A sense of justice and
                  faith in the best qualities are inherent to him, so he finds
                  it difficult to come to a realization of such let-downs.
                  Rarely gives compliments but is usually well-wishing towards
                  other people, tries to understand their wishes and needs, to
                  be helpful to all. Gladly gives advice on how to get out of
                  difficult situations. Avoids disagreements and conflicts.
                  Supports good, friendly relations. If necessary, attempts to
                  explain the reasons for his mistakes and unethical actions.

                  Not vain. Defends his own interests with less vigor than the
                  interests of those whom he cares for, although sometimes he
                  can become principled and unyielding in matters that are of
                  importance to him. Not always responsible and can promise that
                  which he isn’t able to deliver. Knowing this, he sometimes
                  resorts to never giving promises to anyone not to spoil his
                  relations.

                  Reluctantly deals with everyday life, yielding initiative to
                  others over such matters. In issues that concern aesthetics
                  often relies on tastes of his partner. Quite absent-minded and
                  sometimes forgets what he needs to do. Getting distracted by
                  the little things, sometimes runs out of time to meet
                  important deadlines. Having to live by a schedule and
                  constantly maintain order feels like a burden for him.

                  His behavior is unpredictable and full of contrasts. His gaze

                  Loves to expose everything to logical analysis. May be engaged
                  in theoretical development if it has the potential of being
                  implemented into practice. Critically thinks over old theories
                  and methods and is able to create qualitatively new ones. Can
                  turn vague ideas into well designed, easy to implement,
                  concrete projects. Can feel potential and future prospects,
                  has a good marketing sense. Quickly loses interest in what has
                  been done. Due to this can scatter himself and not finish
                  everything that he has started, unless it concerns something
                  that is important and fundamental for him. Often completely
                  changes his types of activity and plunges into something new.
                  Avidly engages in projects and opportunities that cannot be
                  fully exhausted.

                  Has an inclination to impose his views on others. In cases
                  when he has been proven wrong, it is difficult for him to
                  admit it. Does not succumb to intimidation. He can issue a
                  challenge to a superior opponent even without any actual
                  chances of success. In arguments and discussions he is
                  excitable and often hot tempered. When he is put under
                  pressure he boldly and aggressively fights back. When there is
                  panic, he calmly and confidently takes the initiative in his
                  hands, becomes focused and decisive, acts quickly and
                  logically. Can find a way out of any difficult situation.

                  Active and energetic. Savvy in strategic questions and
                  enterprising. Readily attracts people to new undertakings if
                  he considers them promising. He is constantly on the lookout
                  for new approaches and solutions to the present problems.
                  Doesn’t stop on what has been accomplished. Suggests radical
                  solutions. Ambitious. If necessary can be tough and assertive.
                  Does not like to compromise.

                  As a leader prefers that everyone would be in their places
                  occupied by their work. Encourages people around him to
                  activity, teamwork, and cohesion. Democratic by nature, tries
                  to be the first among equals. Not inclined to show respect for
                  ranks and conformity. Easily switches to a more familiar
                  language in his conversations with others. Shows his positive
                  predisposition by a handshake and a friendly smile. Tries to
                  be fair to all but is not afraid to say the truth directly.
                  Wants to be respected. Can be unrestrained in arguments and
                  disputes. Tries to distance himself from imposing people who
                  want to use him to their advantage.

                  From time to time needs to spend time in a good company or
                  engage in other activities (sports or hobbies) in order to
                  raise his vitality and spirits. Likes to make useful contacts.
                  Since he is not always a good judge of character, sometimes
                  keeps questionable acquaintances. As a consequence of this, he
                  is inclined to periodically become disillusioned with people.
                  Has difficulties creating positive, stable relationships, but
                  despite being scattered he usually tries to keep his promises.

                  Mistrustful of feelings. Afraid to show how he feels being
                  uncertain in subsequent reaction of his partner. Painfully
                  experiences uncertainty in relationships. If he believes the
                  reciprocity is there, he will honestly speak of his
                  shortcomings because he is afraid of letting down the hopes
                  and expectations of his partner and well as being let down
                  himself. Afraid of becoming dependent on his partner. Often
                  puts work interests above personal attachments. Any reproaches
                  or criticisms irritate him. Can vehemently and sharply defend
                  his independence and point of view, but later regrets it and
                  tries to smooth things over if he cares for the person.
