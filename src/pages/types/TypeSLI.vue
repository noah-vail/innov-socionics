                          SLI is economical and prudent in dealing with material
                          resources. He is more likely to try to mend old and
                          worn out things than to throw them away. His mindset
                          has a technological bent. He searches for simple but
                          effective methods for resolving problems. Before
                          taking on some task, SLI thinks over several options
                          to achieve the desired result, and stops on the most
                          economical one. Works only by methods that are most
                          convenient to him. Notes those who shrink away from
                          work and ponders about how to make them work or get
                          rid of them. Himself will do only that which is
                          necessary. Works well with any instruments,
                          masterfully applies technical equipment. Often can
                          work well with his hands. Constantly tries to improve
                          his knowledge, skill, and professional level in any
                          chosen field of activity. Hopes for guaranteed and

                          labor and studies.

                          quality of “being taken in by life”. Shows his
                          skepticism by employing specific kind of humor,
                          ironizes. However, deep in his soul he remains an
                          optimist and doesn’t lose hope in a positive outcome.
                          In an emergency situation, he doesn’t panic but looks
                          for ways to buy time. Follows and orients by his inner
                          impressions to the external events. Feels dependent on
                          the vicissitudes of fate. Takes on life’s shocks,
                          trying to protect his loved ones from them; however,
                          it is difficult for him to bear such burden for long.

                          of instability and potentially poor relations. During

                          dispute, but if he feels that his values have been
                          trespassed upon he responds harshly. Won’t be frank
                          with outsiders. Doesn’t like it when someone tries to
                          “peer into his soul” and penetrate into his inner
                          feelings. He must be understood without words.

                          SLI likes it when his abilities and achievements are

                          abilities are not needed or requested for a long time.
                          Needs new, challenging situations and unusual problems
                          that can distract him from the monotony of everyday
                          life. If he feels uninterested in something, he will
                          simply detach and go about his business. Needs to be
                          inspired and encouraged to take up a task, otherwise
                          he will demobilize and fall into inertia and

                          drops. He responds well to a language of compliments
                          and praises that promises timely success. His state is
                          optimal when the success is just out of reach, yet

                  Original person with strongly expressed individuality, but due

                  background. Combines sober realism and practicality with a
                  drive for self-development. If he finds his calling, can
                  pursue it for a long time, eventually achieving high skill and
                  professionalism. He is never fully satisfied with what has
                  been achieved and constantly develops it further, providing
                  the best form for the content. Curious, tangentially
                  interested in other ways for expressing and apply his talents
                  and abilities, trying himself in various directions. However,
                  he poorly sees future prospects of projects and work, and due
                  to this may miss out on important opportunities. Frequently

                  impressionable. Intolerant of boorishness, poor tastes,
                  callousness and crassness. Dislikes pathos, demonstrative
                  appeals and calls, as well as prideful attitudes, conceit.
                  He’s impressed by bold, sincere, friendly, and open people,
                  who encourage him, instill belief in success and lift his
                  spirits. An unpredictable and independent by nature partner
                  sparks in him a sense of curiosity and a desire to keep such a

                  Uncompromising in matters of principle. Does not like to

                  take into account the rules and regulations of his milieu.
                  Quite mobile, cherishes inner personal peace and freedom of
                  action. Sometimes finds it interesting to test himself in
                  complex situations, to overcome difficulties, which adds to
                  his self-affirmation, however, dislikes taking excessive risks
                  and recklessness. Suffers from changeable moods that affect
                  his performance. Does not like forcing himself to do
                  something. If others violate his inner balance, he can get
                  hot-tempered, flare up, of which later he may regret. In most

                  Poorly tolerates routine, monotony, and boredom. Falls into

                  for a long time. Cannot engage in lengthy paper-pushing or
                  purely intellectual work. Dislikes abstract conversations,
                  prefers deeds instead. Needs specific, practical activities,
                  outdoor engagements, and frequent change of impressions for
                  vitality. Dislikes obeying someone else’s will and schedule.
                  Won’t take up useless work, but if he is passionate about
                  something, develops high work capacity. Prepares for tasks and
                  assignments in advance, thinking through the details of work
                  he needs to do, to later work smoothly, accurately, and

                  unapproachable and official, though he tries to create an
                  atmosphere of simplicity and ease. Internally emotional and
                  vulnerable, but manages to avoid conflict by showing good
                  judgment and diplomacy. Critical, ridiculing, sarcastic, but
                  tries to spare the feelings of others and thus speaks of their
                  flaws only at the appropriate time and in harmless manner. Not
                  interested in the personal lives of others and speaks of his
                  own with reluctance. Tries to be faithful in relationships and
                  to always keep his promises.

                  Strives towards well provided for life, which motivates him to
                  work and activity. Inclined to arrange everything with
                  convenience for himself, although tries taking interests of
                  others into account. Can delay making a decision, needs
                  support and inspiration. Once the decision is made, despite
                  seeming inertia and relaxation, shows enviable perseverance in
                  achieving his goals. Does not explain to anyone else the
                  process of his work. His achievements and results are often a

                  originality in clothing and in the interior of the room, does
                  not like standards, pays much attention to quality.
                  Appreciates handmade creative work, whether it’s playing a

                  A creative person of practical inclinations. Technological,
                  rational, quick-thinking in business. Has low tolerance for
                  unoriginality, cliches, and primitivism in working methods.
                  Seeks and searched for new methods for improving labor.
                  Skeptical and distrustful towards new ideas, oriented at quick
                  and concrete results. Does not suffice with old approaches and
                  takes risks in testing innovative solutions in practice.

                  ingenuity and perseverance. Knows how to squeeze the most out
                  of an idea. Hardworking and energetic, cannot stand wasteful
                  expenditures of time and efforts. Likes to work as hard as he
                  can, quickly and efficiently, with high productivity.
                  Appreciates convenience and good working conditions.

                  This is an individualist, on whom it’s difficult to impose
                  anything. Prefers to solve his problems on his own, by the
                  means he has at his disposal. Does not like asking for help or
                  loaning anything. Prefers to have all he needs at his
                  disposal, to not depend on anyone else. Everything that is
                  needed for work, project, or business he acquires in advance.
                  Tries to have the entire inventory of “tools” needed for
                  rational labor and active leisure time.

                  All of the adaptations, equipment, and tools needed for his
                  work he keeps in perfect order, which allows to save time in
                  work when they become needed. Becomes very upset if he forgets
                  to put something in its place and then has to search for it
                  for a long time. Dislikes paperwork drudgery and finds
                  opportunities to reduce it to a minimum. All the needed
                  documentation he keeps in order to avoid further wasting of
                  time.

                  Usually reaches a high level of professionalism and excellence
                  in his occupation, but is somewhat unsure in himself and
                  diffident, prone to having doubts and fluctuations. In need of
                  moral and material incentives. Undemonstrative, but is very
                  sensitive to the assessment of his abilities and becomes
                  offended if his work is not noticed and not praised. At the
                  same time, dislikes undeserved compliments. Respects capable
                  and talented people; tries to create all the possible
                  conditions for the development of their abilities.

                  Contrasting in his behavior: relaxed and quietly
                  contemplative, then suddenly active and mobile. Cannot be in
                  the same place or engage in the same task for a long time.
                  Impatient, does not like it when the same subject is discussed
                  at length. Himself is usually not very wordy and may be quiet.
                  Good at distributing his own activities and assignments: if
                  there is time he does not rush things, but once he feels that
                  there is time to act, he becomes very mobile, hurrying himself
                  and others. Usually does everything by the deadlines, despite
                  the fact that he often gets distracted by other activities.
                  Very efficient, proactive, and clever when it comes to taking
                  care of household and economic problems. Willingly engages in
                  physical labor, repairs things, facilities and equipment. Can
                  do much with his own hands.

                  Strives to be knowledgeable over various topics. Very curious
                  and may read a lot. Has many diverse interests, easily learns
                  something new. A good lecturer or teacher, as he can explain
                  complex things simply and effectively. Does not tolerate
                  criticism and suggestions on topic on which he views himself
                  competent. In conversation, tries to persuade others using
                  logic and facts. It is hard to convince him in a dispute. In
                  what he considers to be true, he is persistent up to being
                  obstinate: does not go for a compromise even in the most
                  critical situations. Proving his own correctness he becomes
                  hot-tempered, impulsive and unhinged.

                  Secretive and suspicious. Dislikes being the center of
                  attention. Finds it difficult to fit into a society he is
                  unfamiliar and unaccustomed with. Reluctantly makes contact
                  with unfamiliars and strangers, prefers to communicate with
                  like-minded people. Not accepting of familiarity, can with a
                  look or gesture to put a person in his or her place. Has a
                  heightened sense for maliciousness, affectedness and
                  falsehood. Cannot bring himself to talk to the needed, but
                  unpleasant to him people. After break relations with someone,
                  does not go for reconciliations and concessions first, even if
                  he has realized that he was in the wrong.

                  If others don’t understand him, he withdraws into himself and
                  becomes cold, sharp, and unapproachable. Does not know how to
                  eliminate tension in communication, prefers to leave and
                  separate himself from the previous conversation partner with a
                  wall of silence. Responsive only to the kindness and
                  sincerity. Cannot stand hypocrisy. Himself if very honest in
                  relationships, conscientious, obligated and punctual. He can
                  always be relied upon: reliable in friendship, love and
                  business. Readily comes to aid of the first request,
                  sympathizes with another’s misfortune or grief. However, he
                  can always turn away from a person who has lost his trust and
                  respect.

                  Grows tired of monotony and routine. Willingly travels.
                  Interactions with nature calm him down. New occupations,
                  interests, and hobbies raise his vitality and help him to
                  overcome apathy. Often he enjoys sports, the excitement in the
                  competition. Not averse to experiencing thrilling and risky
                  sensations, but without the risk of injury. Careful towards
                  all living things: people, nature, animals, and even insects.
                  Does not “play” with his own or another’s life. Does not
                  tolerate coercion, and himself does not know how to pressure
                  others. Find it difficult to hit anyone, but, at the same
                  time, he is very independent and not always considerate of the
                  interests of others when they do not coincide with his own.
                  When someone tries to limit his freedoms, he may break up the
                  relations.

                  Has a hard time enduring through physical and mental
                  discomfort, and tries to do everything possible to remove it.
                  For the same reason, avoids bad habits. Closely monitors his
                  health and physical form. Appreciates beauty and harmony in
                  everything, although finds it difficult to reach an internal
                  balance. Very impressionable, inclined to fall into depression
                  even over minor reasons. A fatalist at heart, believer in the
                  inevitability, and does not try to forcibly change the course
                  of events. Often lacks in resoluteness.

                  Suspicious and proud. Afraid to show awkward emotions or to
                  seem intrusive, thus hides his problems from the outsiders,
                  preferring to suffer them alone. Finds it difficult to express
                  his feelings in words. Does not like to demonstrate how he
                  feels in front of strangers. Tries to talk of love in a joking
                  humorous manner, risking being misunderstood. Not sentimental,
                  manifestation of tenderness come to him with much difficulty.
                  Proves his love by actions and deeds and not by words. Very
                  attentive, caring, and dedicated. If misunderstandings happen,
                  he usually does not attempt to justify himself or make
                  excuses. Internally he feels himself lonely, if there is no
                  sensitive tactful person by his side, capable of understanding
                  everything without extraneous words, and of encouraging him in
                  times of pessimism and melancholy.
