              Inclination for comfortable and pleasant group atmosphere, in the
              emotional, sensorial, and intellectual aspects. An ideal Alpha
              group situation is the exchange of light-hearted jokes while
              discussing imaginative ideas, movies, or sometimes sports, all
              while enjoying pleasant food and drink. Narrating personal
              experiences usually takes the form of telling a joke; funny
              personal experiences are preferred over "serious" ones.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              The exchange of sober concrete details are avoided. If the group
              is playing a game together, the fun and jokes that go along with
              it are at least as important as the game itself. They avoid
              generating "heavy" moments; any dramatic expressions are limited
              in time, most often in service of a joke.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              Alphas are also perhaps the most likely types to participate in
              group use of mind-altering substances. Alpha discussions tend to
              go off on tangents, in whatever direction seems most interesting
              or funny at the moment. Unusual personal observations are common,
              resulting from the analysis of the idiosyncrasies or
              inconsistencies of everyday life.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              If many in the group share the same observations, they are likely
              to express their agreement emphatically, so as to create a kind of
              "mental harmony" which enhances the group dynamic. If a new
              problem is encountered, it is expanded and developed in as many
              ways as possible, until some kind of satisfactory conclusion is
              reached.

              Alphas make no distinction between "insiders" and "outsiders",

              though they tend to just as easily withdraw if the person is not
              receptive. Likewise, they prefer to have the same behavior at work
              as at play; they find formal speech and dress to be pretentious,
              unnecessarily limiting, and even ridiculous. Alphas dislike the
              idea that there is something going on "behind the scenes",
              preferring to keep things (especially personal motivations) as
              open and straightforward as possible.

              in a situation where there are "group rituals" going on (as in
              drinking, dancing, etc), there is good-natured pressure on
              "outsiders" to also participate in them, with a sort of puzzled
              dismay if they prefer not to. They also try to draw attention to
              people who might otherwise feel left out - usually this is done
              with general jokes directed at individuals.

              Personal experiences tend to be discussed from the point of view
              of their external impact rather than the individual's own personal
              view of them.

              When larger social events are organized by Betas (such as parties,
              receptions etc), they show an inclination to promote activities
              that will lead to the guests involved as a single group, such as
              games and shows; dislike for the "quieter" form of events where
              guests tend to quietly form smaller groups in more intimate
              atmospheres, which Betas tend to see as boring.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              For Betas atmosphere is more important than specific activity or
              topic. Groups of betas spend time together to entertain each
              other. They exchange fun (and often loud) stories to feed the
              atmosphere, so that the group energy won't run out. People talk
              fast and they often add comments to other people's stories if they
              feel that the pace is slowing down. When someone starts to talk,
              he takes on the obligation to entertain for the duration of the
              monologue and, in a friendly group, other people only interrupt to
              try and help him keep control of the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              Talking about personal matters in a group is not something that
              Betas generally do. It's viewed almost as treachery when something
              that was told in a one-on-one conversation is retold in front of a
              group, or when someone criticizes another person's traits in front
              of the group. Betas believe such things should be told in private
              and should not be used to embarrass or belittle a friend.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              Betas also don't like it when people tell long, slow stories.
              Betas try to be polite and listen to the story, and they will
              forgive you if it was boring for them, but if someone does it too
              often they might not be invited back. Betas restrict long-winded
              stories to one-on-one conversations. However, IEIs are more likely
              to adjust to the slower stories because they are very flexible
              conversationalists

              Beta romantic relationships tend to start from intense exchanges
              of emotions, either of a playful, aggressive sort, or of a more
              "tormented" sort based on personal images of special meaning,
              "romantic" in a 19th-century sense.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              The two sorts merge together to make Beta the quadra most inclined
              towards "romantic courtship" in the everyday sense of the term. A
              relationship is felt to be "lacking" if not accompanied by intense
              demonstrations of emotions.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              Romantic relationships are also held together by a sense of common
              goals and purpose, and of the other person as the best partner
              towards achieving them.

              ambition, needing to be led, and more concerned with refining the
              world of ideas and fun than the "real world". Usually, a group
              which consists of members of both quadras gets along much better
              than Alpha-Beta inter-quadra pairs of people. In groups, Fe starts
              to dominate and there is a lot of active laughter as the Betas
              tell loud stories, and the Alphas make goofy suggestions for
              entertainment. On individual level, the differences are more
              difficult to overcome because values are different.

              Betas tend to regard Gamma types as stand-offish and occasionally
              emotionally hostile, judgemental, and inclined to not seeing the
              "big picture" in political or work situations, a combination of
              political naivity and moral stiffness which may end up
              jeopardizing the Betas' goals. Socially boring, "can't take a
              joke", vindictive. A group consisting of Betas and Gammas does not
              mix well. Betas try to make general jokes, but Gammas make
              extremely personal sharp jokes. Gammas like everyone to take care
              of their own needs and people are constantly moving and forming
              small groups but Betas want people to stay together. Gammas feel
              that Betas are trying to restrict their fun and Betas feel that
              Gammas are just trying to break the fun group. However, on a
              personal level Betas and Gammas often get along very well - they
              discuss politics, religion, nature, etc. They both see the general
              trends and they compare predictions of what will happen next.
              Betas view the general emotions motivating the events and Gammas
              view the objective facts so they might not agree but the
              conversations are intriguing, nonetheless

              Betas tend to regard Delta types as noncommittal in their
              unwillingness to support goals decided in a group, lack of drive,
              and ethical self-righteousness. Rather than back group efforts
              that require vision and concentration of effort, Delta types
              prefer to just work on personal projects. Equally mixed groups of
              Betas and Deltas get along just fine. Nothing great, nothing
              horrible. Deltas tell their personal views, but they don't feel
              comfortable enough to get too personal and Betas make general
              jokes to entertain others but don't feel playful enough to make
              loud jokes that might offend Deltas. But when there's a quadra
              dominance, things go bad very fast. The Beta group is too loud and
              impersonal for Deltas and the Delta group is too muted and
              personal for Betas. Betas want to express their views and opinions
              very openly, while Deltas want everyone to keep any possibly
              offensive views to themselves.

              a sense of purpose and who can get things done, usually with very
              strong views, as in political issues or ways of approaching work,
              which Gammas tend to see as not backed by sufficient factual
              confirmation and therefore too ideological. Gammas also may regard
              Betas as two-faced when bent on achieving a goal, and too
              concerned with their social status, and that of others, within any

              ambition with a longer-term perspective, as well as being overly

              unproductiveness of different ways of doing things - even in such
              emotional areas as personal relationships. Delta types value
              peaceful, refreshing activities where they are doing something
              useful and balancing out their inner world at the same time. Delta
              types have the philosophy that they will have to rely on their own
              industriousness to achieve their goals rather than on luck,
              speculation, group effort, or strong leadership

              preferring instead to talk in more neutral terms about what they
              want to do and why. Delta types reject dramatism and emotional
              affect in favor of wry humor and understatement. Delta types don't
              tend to form or maintain groups based on fun, emotional
              interaction, but only take groups seriously that perform some
              common productive or restful activity. Delta types generally
              dislike using poetic wording when describing their inner state,
              but talk simply about what they feel or their bodily sensations

              Delta types do not fare well in high-pressure situations where

              Groups made up of primarily Delta types tend to be focused on
              working on projects, enjoying physical recreation, or finding out
              interesting things about each other. Laughter is usually subdued
              and brief; instead, people smile a lot and try to be witty and
              welcoming.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              Groups need to be focused on some specific productive activity or
              topic of discussion, or else they fall apart. In Delta groups,
              there is a lot of splintering and decentralization. This allows
              for more focused and productive interaction with only those who
              share your particular interests or sentiments.

              People jump from small group to small group easily to keep up
              their interest level. No one demands that the entire group listen
              to one person or that everyone do the same thing. Delta Quadra
              types believe that if everyone just pursues their own interests
              and makes some accommodations for others, the group will be better
              off anyway.

              Delta Quadra types do not focusing on building group identity or

              Delta romantic relationships usually begin simply as the encounter
              of two individuals interested in a relationship and each other in
              a particular moment, with very little in terms of outward
              demonstrations of "romance" in the "wooing" sense of the term or
              in strong external demonstrations of emotions.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph roboto-light">
              Deltas are more focused on the present moment than Gammas, and
              therefore even relationships of very strong attachment do not lead
              to constant concerns as to their longer-term practical
              feasibility. Deltas see as optimal romantic relationships those
              where partners spend time together on fun activities and sharing
              ideas of potential practical application. Romantic atmospheres are
              low-key, based on comfort but practicality
